<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">THE END OF A TRAIL</p>

<p class="drop-cap05"><span class="beg">THERE</span> was a smell of burning spruce in the
sharp air, and Corporal Bracknell, of the
North-west Mounted Police, threw back
his head and sniffed it gratefully. His team of
dogs had been conscious of it for some time, and
now, quickening the pace, they broke into joyous
yelps as they turned inward towards the Saskatoon
bushes on the left bank of the frozen river. The
corporal smiled to himself.</p>

<p>“They’re wise dogs,” he muttered, “but not wise
enough to know the trail’s end. I wonder if I shall
find the man here.”</p>

<p>He followed the well-marked track towards
the bank. The aromatic smell of the spruce grew
stronger, but there was nothing to be seen save
the shadowy woods, and the packed sled-road between.
The road had been cut through the trees,
and here and there a stump bearing the mark of
the ax protruded above the snow. For perhaps
three hundred yards it ran in a bee-line between
the tall trunks, and then turned abruptly to the
right. He reached the turning, and looked about
him curiously. The road still continued, but the
end of it was not in sight, for again it turned, as it
seemed to him into the very heart of the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a house or encampment somewhere
about,” he said to himself, “but&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly as something caught his
eye. It was a new-marked sled-trail debouching
from the main track, and he stooped to examine
it carefully. When he straightened himself there
was an eager light in his eye, and curbing his impatient
dogs he stood considering for a full two
minutes.</p>

<p>“He may have a shack here,” so his thoughts ran,
“but if there’s more than that, why this broad
road?”</p>

<p>He considered the avenue made by the sombre
pinewoods on each side of the road, and then shook
his head. “Too much style for Koona Dick.
There must be a homestead somewhere about, but
if those are not the marks of his sled-runners I’m
a dutchman.”</p>

<p>He spoke a word or two to his well-trained dogs,
and slipping off his snowshoes turned towards the
trail which led into the wood, and began to follow
it carefully. As he walked, he unbuttoned the pistol-holster
at his waist, and gripped the handle of
the weapon in preparation for action. The man
whose trail he believed that he was following was
not given to being over-scrupulous. He had pursued
him for nearly four hundred miles, and now
that the end of the chase was in sight, it behoved him
to be cautious, for if Koona Dick suspected his
presence his resentment of it might even go to the
extreme length of a rifle bullet. He left the trail,
and began to move cautiously from tree to tree.</p>

<p>The short Northland day was almost over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Dusk was coming on apace, and the gloom under
the trees deepened, little misgivings awake in his
mind.</p>

<p>Was it wise to follow the track into the heart
of the wood? His dogs were good dogs, but&mdash;</p>

<p>The sudden sharp crash of a rifle echoed
through the stillness, followed immediately by a
second, and that by the sharp cry of a woman assailed
by mortal terror, and then there came the
quick yelp of dogs. He turned in his tracks and
began to run back under the trees.</p>

<p>How long it was before he reached the main
trail he never knew, but never in his life had he
run so fast before. Fear was pounding at his
heart. His dogs? If they were gone&mdash;</p>

<p>He reached the edge of the wood to find them
still where he had left them, and his relief found
expression in a quick “Thank God!” He looked
round him, up and down the road and into the
dark woods on either hand. There was nothing
to be seen, and the coming of night had already
shortened the range of vision. He stood listening
intently. No sound broke the awful silence
that had followed the shots and the curdling cry
of fear. His hand, resting on the gee-pole of the
sled, shook a little.</p>

<p>“It was a woman,” he whispered, “a white
woman, at that. There’s some infernal mystery
about. I wonder if Koona Dick&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not finish the thought. Setting his face
to the turn in the road, he gave the dogs the word
and they moved forward. Somewhere at the end
of the road there was a human habitation. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that he was convinced. He would find it, and perhaps
at the same time find Koona Dick and the
solution of that mysterious cry which had so suddenly
startled the silent woods.</p>

<p>But he was not destined to reach the end of the
road without further adventure. As he reached
the turn he became aware of a narrow road on
the left hand cut at right angles from the main
track, and as he looked down it, saw a shadowy
figure moving swiftly between the trees straight
towards him. Against the fading light and the
white background of snow he made out the form
of a woman, and instantly halted his dogs with
the intention of speaking to her. She was perhaps
five and twenty yards away when he first saw
her, and the distance between them she covered
at a run, approaching him apparently without seeing
him. Her line of progression brought her
within four yards of the place where he stood
waiting in the shadow of a giant spruce. Still she
did not see him, and he was about to make his
presence known, when the sight of her face
checked him.</p>

<p>It was a young face, and beautiful, but as he
saw it, it was a picture of incarnate terror. The
eyes were staring as in horror. There was a
stony look about the cameo-like features, and he
caught the gasping intake of breath as she passed
him. He had seen terror in feminine faces before,
once when a drunken half-breed had lifted a
knife to slay, and once on the face of an Indian
girl, swept towards the White Horse Rapids on
the Yukon in a frail canoe, and he had no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
whatever as to the emotion which found expression
in that stonily beautiful face. The girl was
badly frightened. He was quite certain of that,
and the fact of her passing both himself and his
team without observing them was further evidence
that she was in great stress of mind. As
she hurried by something in her hand caught his
eye. It was a rifle carried at the trail.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood there undecided what
to do. Once he made as if to follow the girl, and
then checking himself again, stood considering.
Those two shots which he had heard&mdash;what did
they mean? They had sounded quite close, and
now there came this girl, clearly badly frightened,
carrying a rifle and hurrying from the wood. He
looked up the narrow path between the gloomy
pines, his trained mind and his instincts working
together. Something had occurred in the wood,
something tragical, or it had not brought that
look on the girl’s face. What was it?</p>

<p>Tired as he was with the day’s travel, and certain
though he was of the nearness of some house
of rest, he could not leave the problem unsolved.
For the moment he even forgot Koona Dick, and
again leaving his dogs he turned into the path
from which the girl had emerged. He moved
cautiously, with the service pistol in his hand. He
did not know what to expect, and he was not inclined
to be caught unprepared. Once, as he
walked in the darkness of the trees, he paused,
and throwing back the ear-flaps of his fur-cap,
stood listening. No sound reached him,
though a moment before he had caught a noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
which had seemed like the snapping of a dry twig.
Thinking he must have been mistaken, he resumed
his way. As he did so, a shadowy form behind
him slid from one tree trunk to another; and as he
progressed the form in the wood followed, evidently
stalking him.</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell, however, remained unconscious
of the shadow, and moving quickly but silently
on his way, came suddenly upon something
which brought him to an abrupt halt. In the
snow not three yards from where he stood lay the
huddled form of a man. For a moment he stared
at it as if fascinated, and as the man did not move,
when the moment had passed he stepped swiftly
forward, and bent over the inanimate form. The
man was lying on his side, and a dark stain in the
snow the corporal divined was blood. Apparently
the man was dead, and as it was now too
dark to see his face, the corporal felt in his pouch
and produced a tin box of sulphur matches.
Striking one, he waited until the sulphur had finished
spluttering, and when the wood was fairly
alight, he bent over the prostrate form, shading
the match with his hands so as to throw the light
upon the man’s face. Then suddenly he dropped
the match and stood upright.</p>

<p>“Koona Dick!” he muttered, and then whistled
softly to himself.</p>

<p>He struck another match and looked again in
order to make sure. As for the second time the
flickering light fell on the face in the snow, every
doubt vanished. The man who was lying there
was the man whom he had followed for <i>four</i> hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
miles through the waste, the man whom he
had hoped to make his prisoner, but who now, if
appearances were to be trusted, had finally escaped
him. Dropping the match as it burned towards
the end, he thrust his hand inside the man’s fur
parka to feel if the heart were beating. He could
detect no movement, and as he withdrew the hand,
he stood upright, and as he considered question
after question went through his mind at the gallop.</p>

<p>Who had killed Koona Dick? The girl whom
he had met with that look of frozen terror on her
face? Who was she? Had she shot the man lying
at his feet? Why had she done so? Where did
she live? As the last question shot in his mind
he knew that the answer to it was in his grasp.
He had seen the direction she had followed, and
he guessed that whatever homestead lay at the
end of that road cut through the forest would be
her dwelling place. As this conviction surged
into his mind the whining of his dogs came to his
ears. They were evidently growing restless, and
since he could do nothing by lingering there, after
one glance at the still form lying in the snow, he
swung on his heel, and made all speed back to
where his team awaited him. They yelped with
delight as he appeared, and when he gave the
word, bounded impatiently forward along the well-beaten
track.</p>

<p>Four minutes later, a turn in the road unexpectedly
brought into view the homestead that he
was seeking. It was set in the midst of a large
clearing, and from its outline in the darkness was
of considerable proportions for a Northland lodge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Lights shone in three of the windows, and just
as he reached the wooden fence which ran round
the house, a door opened, and a light within
streaming through outlined the form of a man in
the act of entering.</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell shouted to him, and the man
turned round and peered into the darkness, then
he rested something against the wooden wall of
the passage, shut the door, and moved towards
the policeman.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked, as he came nearer.</p>

<p>“Corporal Bracknell&mdash;on Dominion service,”
replied the policeman.</p>

<p>“Corporal Bracknell?”</p>

<p>As the man echoed the words the corporal caught
a puzzled note in his tones, and explained further.</p>

<p>“Yes, of the Mounted Police.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course! I was not thinking of the
Mounted service. I am a stranger in the Nor’-West&mdash;”
Bracknell had already divined that such
must be the case, but he did not say so. He laughed
lightly, and made his wants known.</p>

<p>“I’m on service, and tired. I should be grateful
for supper and a bunk if that is possible.”</p>

<p>“It is quite possible, Officer, and Joy&mdash;I mean
Miss Gargrave will be very glad to oblige you.
She is always pleased to play the Good Samaritan.”</p>

<p>As the man spoke the name, the corporal remembered
that he had heard it before. It had been
borne by an eccentric Englishman, who had been
reported enormously wealthy and who had perished
rather tragically on the Klondyke, three years before,
and the mystery of whose death had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
been cleared up, satisfactorily. He knew now
where he was.</p>

<p>“This is the North Star Lodge, then?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes!” was the reply. “Will you go in now
and attend to your team afterwards, or&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In my service,” laughed Bracknell, “the dogs
come first.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the other. “I will wait
for you!”</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette and watched the corporal
whilst he loosed the dogs from the traces, and
fed them with frozen fish. The light from the
window fell on his face and showed that he was
less interested in the operation than in the man
engaged upon it, for never for a moment did his
eyes leave the officer, and there was a ruminative
look in them, as if he were speculating what manner
of man the policeman was. The corporal was
quite conscious of the stare, but gave no sign of it,
though once or twice as he moved about, he flashed
a glance at the stranger, endeavouring in his turn to
take the other’s measure. When he had finished
his task he turned to him.</p>

<p>“I am ready now.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” laughed the man; “it is cold waiting
about.”</p>

<p>He threw his cigarette away, and moved towards
the door of the house. Corporal Bracknell followed
him, and as the door opened his guide stumbled
over something which fell with a clatter on
the pinewood floor.</p>

<p>The man stooped and picked it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“My rifle,” he explained. “I had forgotten it
was there. I rested it against the wall when you
hailed me.”</p>

<p>The corporal nodded, but made no remark.
His thoughts were engaged with Koona Bill lying
out there under the shadow of the pines, and he
was wondering what the meeting with Joy Gargrave
would be like, guessing as he did that she
must be the girl who had passed him out in the
wood. His companion conducted him to a room
that for the Northland was positively luxurious,
and waved him a chair near the stove.</p>

<p>“You will like to change your socks and moccasins,”
he said politely. “I will go and inform Miss
Gargrave, and return for you in ten minutes or so.
It should be almost dinner time.”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell nodded, and when the man
had departed looked round the room with some
curiosity. Nowhere in the wild region where his
work was done was there another such room, he
was sure. Even the commandant’s rooms down
at the Post were poor beside it. The furniture
was of excellent quality. The wall was match-boarded,
hiding the outer logs, and there were furs
everywhere. Pictures too! Something familiar in
one of them caught his eye, and moving towards
it he saw that it was a photograph of Newham College,
Cambridge.</p>

<p>He stood looking at it, whistling softly to himself.
He himself had been at Caius, and having a
sister at Newham, had once or twice had tea in
its precincts. He wondered what the picture was
doing here in this lodge in the northern wilderness,
and he was still wondering when a gong sounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Hastily he began to change his socks, and the operation
was scarcely completed, when the man who
had introduced him to the house appeared.</p>

<p>“Ready, Corporal?”</p>

<p>“Almost,” he replied, and half a minute later
stood up and nodded.</p>

<p>“This way,” said the other laconically, and led
the way out of the room and across the wide passage.
The policeman was prepared for surprises,
but the appearance of the room into which he entered
almost took his breath away. Except for
the roaring Yukon stove, and the fur rugs on the
polished floor, it was a replica of the typical dining-room
of an English country house. The furniture
was Jacobean, the table was laid with the whitest
napery, and silver and glasses gleamed on its whiteness.
He had a quick apprehension of oil-paintings
on the wall, of a long-cased clock in the corner,
and of two girls standing together near the stove,
then his companion’s voice sounded.</p>

<p>“Corporal Bracknell! Miss Gargrave! Miss
La Farge.”</p>

<p>He bowed to the two ladies in turn. The second
he knew as he glanced at her was of French
Canadian extraction, with perhaps a dash of Indian
blood in her veins; but the first was a golden-haired
English girl, tall, blue-eyed, with face a little
bronzed by the open-air, and&mdash;the girl who had
passed him with her face the index of mortal terror
and her rifle at the trail. It was she who spoke in
a voice that had the indescribable accent of culture.</p>

<p>“We are pleased to see you, Corporal Bracknell.
No doubt, if you have been long on the trail, you
will be ready for dinner.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pch">A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE</p>

<p class="drop-cap05"><span class="beg">FEELING</span> like a man in a dream, the corporal
took his seat at the table, and when the soup
was served by an Indian youth, he was too
much amazed to attempt conversation. Miss Gargrave
looked at him and casually asked, “You have
never been to North Star before, Mr. Bracknell?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, shaking his head. “I am
new to this district. I was transferred from Edmonton
four months ago.”</p>

<p>“Then you did not know of our existence?”</p>

<p>The corporal smiled. “I had heard something
of it; but the truth is I had forgotten all about it.”</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “I can understand that. We
are so far out of the track of things that it is easy
for the world to forget us.”</p>

<p>Bracknell would have liked to ask why such as
she should continue to live in the wilderness; but he
repressed his curiosity, and looking round smiled
again.</p>

<p>“Your solitude is not without its amenities. I
did not think there was such a room as this anywhere
in the north. It reminds one of home!”</p>

<p>“You are English, of course?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “I come from Kendal, in
Westmorland.”</p>

<p>“Kendal?” There was an accent of surprise
in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know Kendal?” he inquired quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “I have stayed in the
neighbourhood. Are you any relation of Sir James
Bracknell of Harrowfell?”</p>

<p>“My uncle and guardian,” he smilingly replied.</p>

<p>Joy Gargrave looked at him thoughtfully. “I
have met your uncle,” she said slowly. “I should
scarcely have looked for his nephew in the Mounted
Police.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” he demanded, with a laugh. “The
Force is a packet of surprises. My sergeant at Edmonton
was the heir to an Irish peerage, and I
know a trooper down at Alberta who is the second
son of a marquis.”</p>

<p>“But Sir James!” she murmured. “He did not
seem to me the sort of man who would approve&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He does not know,” interrupted the corporal.</p>

<p>“It is very likely that he would not approve if he
did. But that does not greatly matter; as before
I came out here we quarrelled, and the relations between
us are likely to continue strained.”</p>

<p>“Is it permissible to ask the cause of this quarrel?”
inquired the man on the other side of the
table, whose name the corporal had not yet learned.</p>

<p>Bracknell frowned at the directness of the question
and was about to administer a snub, when he
caught Miss Gargrave’s eyes fixed upon him expectantly.
He laughed shortly as he replied, “Well,
Mr.&mdash;ar&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rayner is my name,” said the other. “I forgot
I had not introduced myself.”</p>

<p>The corporal nodded. “I was about to say, Mr.
Rayner, that it is a private matter; but there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
be no harm in saying that my uncle had a matrimonial
scheme for me of which I did not approve,
so here I am.”</p>

<p>He laughed to hide his embarrassment of which
he was conscious, and looked at Miss Gargrave to
whom the explanation had really been offered.
There was a thoughtful look upon her face.</p>

<p>“Sir James is rather dictatorial,” she said, and
then turned the conversation. “Do you like the
service?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply, given wholeheartedly. “It
is a man’s work, and the open-air life, with all the
many hazards of the North, is infinitely preferable
to stewing in chambers waiting for briefs; or devilling
the K.C. who wants to keep all the crumbs on
his own table.”</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “I can understand that,” she
commented, and for a moment she sat there crumbling
her bread.</p>

<p>The thoughtful look on her face was accentuated.
Remembering what he had seen there when she
had passed him in the road, the corporal found
himself wondering if there was any connection between
the two. Then Miss Gargrave spoke again.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are in this neighbourhood on professional
business?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered readily enough. “I have
been following a man for a month and have trailed
him something like four hundred miles.”</p>

<p>“That is a long journey in winter,” said the girl
a trifle absently.</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell smiled. “Nothing to boast
of. There have been many longer trails in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Territory by our men. Did you ever hear how
Constable Pedley took the lunatic missionary from
Fort Chipewayn to Saskatchewan down the Athabasca
River in the very depth of winter?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the girl. “That was an epic.
The constable lost his own reason in the end, didn’t
he?”</p>

<p>Bracknell nodded. “Yes, but he’s better again
now; though naturally that experience has set its
mark on him. And if I had got my man my return
journey would have been much harder than
the journey up, as I should have had to look after
him; and sleep with one eye open all the time.”</p>

<p>“You speak as if you had lost your man,” said
Rayner. “Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have lost him finally,” answered the corporal
slowly.</p>

<p>“Who was he? What had he done? Was he
a very desperate character?” inquired Miss Gargrave,
and to the corporal as he turned to her it
seemed as if there was a look of troubled expectancy
in her face.</p>

<p>“He was an Englishman,” answered Bracknell
quietly, his eyes fixed on the beautiful face. “I do
not know that he was a particularly desperate character,
but he certainly was not scrupulous, and he
was suspected of selling whiskey to the Indians in
the reservation, which is a serious offence in the
Territory.”</p>

<p>“What name?” asked Miss La Farge.</p>

<p>“His proper name I do not know, but he has
been known through the North as Koona Dick!”</p>

<p>As he gave the name he saw Joy Gargrave’s face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
grow white, and the trouble in her eyes was plain.
Also, with the tail of his eye, he saw Mr. Rayner
start violently, and guessed that both he and his
hostess were not unacquainted with the man who
lay out there in the snow under the shadow of the
pines. For a moment after his reply there was a
strained uneasy silence. The corporal removed his
eyes from his hostess’s face and glanced round the
table. Mr. Rayner was fingering the stem of a
wine-glass nervously, whilst Miss La Farge was
looking from him to Miss Gargrave with puzzled
eyes. Evidently she was conscious that something
unusual was taking place, but the corporal was
sure that to her the name he had just spoken was
without any special significance. That it was
known to the other two people present he was certain,
and he waited to see what would follow. The
sense of strain grew more pronounced, then Mr.
Rayner shuffled uneasily and broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I notice, Corporal Bracknell, that you speak of
this&mdash;er&mdash;fellow in the past tense, and you say
that he has escaped you finally. Do you mean to
say that he is&mdash;a&mdash;dead?”</p>

<p>“He is lying in the snow in a path cut through
the trees off the main road to the Lodge,” answered
the corporal steadily, “and he has been shot, I
think.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” ejaculated Mr. Rayner, in a voice
that, whilst it expressed astonishment, seemed to
the corporal to be a little flat. “And we have been
sitting here, gassing, whilst&mdash;” He broke off abruptly.
“Joy,” he cried addressing Miss Gargrave,
“you are ill. The shock of this story&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is nothing,” interrupted the girl in a shaking
voice. “I&mdash;I&mdash;feel a little faint. If you will
excuse me&mdash;” She rose to her feet, staggered
a little, and then, as Miss La Farge ran to her,
fainted outright. For a moment Corporal Bracknell
did not speak, though a look of utmost concern
came upon his face. The situation seemed to him
to be thronged with dreadful possibilities. Remembering
the look on the girl’s face when he had
encountered her in the forest road, and the rifle in
her hand, he found in this faint further support
for the suspicion which had occurred to him when
he had stood by the supine body of Koona Dick.
Living in the wilds, it was scarcely likely that the
news of a dead man would affect her thus, if that
news were without special significance for her.
Death in the Northland&mdash;death sharp and sudden
was not so uncommon as all that. Moving accidents
by flood and field, by wild beasts and wild men,
were part of the general circumstances of wilderness
life; why, therefore, should the girl be thus affected
by the news that he had uttered? Whilst Mr. Rayner
assisted Miss La Farge to carry their hostess
out of the room, he stood there, his mind occupied
by this momentous question. The answer was one
which took the form of a further question and which
filled him with concern. Had she killed Koona
Dick, with whom, as he was sure, she was acquainted?</p>

<p>Again he saw the beautiful face, the picture of
terror and the eyes in their unseeing stare of horror,
and wondered what was the meaning of it all. Had
the girl seen the body of Koona Dick lying there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in the shadow of the pines with his blood staining
the snow, and was she merely frightened; or was
her knowledge of a more intimate and guilty
character? He could not decide, and whilst he
was still wondering, the door of the room opened
and Rayner entered. His face now was mask-like,
and his voice was suave and even as he addressed
the officer.</p>

<p>“I am afraid your story has been a shock to
Miss Gargarve, who has not been very well all day.
You will have to excuse her for this evening; but
that is no reason why you should not finish your
dinner, after which we might go out and look at
this dead man. I suppose he will have to have
sepulchre?”</p>

<p>“Even the worst of us should have that,” answered
the corporal quietly, then added, “Miss
Gargrave&mdash;she is better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was only a faint. I expect she found
it rather shocking to think that whilst we were sat
here, that man was lying dead in the snow outside.”</p>

<p>“I can understand that,” answered the other in
a non-committal voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Rayner nodded. “Feminine nerves are
unstable things.” A second later he asked, “Did
I understand you to say that this man whom you
were following was shot?”</p>

<p>“That is only a guess of mine,” was the reply.
“I found him lying there in the snow, and only a
few minutes before I distinctly heard a rifle fire
twice.”</p>

<p>“But,” objected Mr. Rayner, “it does not follow
that the shots you heard were directed against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this man Koona Dick? I myself fired at a timber-wolf
on the outskirts of the homestead just a little
while before your arrival.”</p>

<p>“Did you fire twice?” asked Corporal Bracknell
quickly.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no! Once!”</p>

<p>There was a little hesitation before the reply
was given. It was but the fraction of a second,
but the policeman marked it, and suspected that the
other had been a little uncertain as to what he
ought to answer.</p>

<p>“But I heard two shots&mdash;one on the heels of the
other,” answered Bracknell.</p>

<p>“One may have been the echo,” suggested Rayner.
“Up here when it is still, sounds are easily
duplicated.”</p>

<p>“No, it was not an echo,” asserted the corporal.
“I am quite sure of that. I have lived in the wilds
too long to be deceived in a small matter of that
sort. The second shot was as real as the first.
And there is another thing I ought to tell you, Mr.
Raynor. Immediately after the second shot I
heard a woman cry out.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rayner looked interested. “Are you quite
sure it was a woman?” he asked. “It may have
been the death-cry of this man&mdash;er&mdash;Koona Dick,
which you heard.”</p>

<p>“That is just possible,” agreed the corporal.
“Yet it seemed to me like the cry of a woman in
terror.”</p>

<p>“It is easy even for trained ears to be mistaken
up here,” said the other suavely. “Since I came
here I have heard a hare scream like a child in agony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The cry you heard may have been no more
than that of some small creature falling a victim to
the law of the wild, which is that the strongest takes
the prey.”</p>

<p>“Maybe!” said Bracknell laconically. In his
heart he did not accept the explanation, plausible
though it was.</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” answered the other, as if determined
to convince him. “In the silence of these
northern forests, as I have noticed often of late,
sounds seem to take strange qualities. The loneliness
accentuates them, and if one has any reason
for suspecting the presence of other humans besides
one’s self, then every sound one hears seems to have
some bearing on the unseen presences.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” replied the policeman, wondering
why the other should be so persistent in the matter;
“but you forget one thing which is rather fatal to
your argument.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?” inquired Rayner quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, I was not expecting to find a woman up
in this wilderness; indeed, it was the last thought
in my mind. That fact makes your argument fail,
at any rate as applied to the cry I heard.”</p>

<p>To this Mr. Rayner made no reply. He pushed
a wine decanter towards the other, and rising from
the table crossed the room to a cabinet, from which
he took out a box of cigars.</p>

<p>“We will have a smoke, before going to look at
this dead man.”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell accepted the cigar, which was
of choice brand, and when he had lit it he looked
at the other&mdash;and said thoughtfully. “I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
wondering why Miss Gargrave lives up here in the
wilds?”</p>

<p>Rayner laughed a little. “I am not surprised at
that. Everybody wonders. But the fact is that
she has no real choice in the matter. As I dare say
you will have heard, Rolf Gargrave was immensely
rich, and he made his daughter his heiress, but on
the condition that for three years after his death
she should live at North Star Lodge. That is the
explanation!”</p>

<p>“But why on earth should he make a condition
of that sort&mdash;- for a girl?”</p>

<p>“He was a crank!” replied Rayner contemptuously.
“He was not an admirer of what is called
modern civilization&mdash;indeed, he detested it most
heartily and whilst he sent his daughter to England
to be educated, he desired to protect her against
society influences; and he believed that a few years
in the North here, in touch with primitive life,
would give her a distaste for the shams and artificialities
of great cities. Also&mdash;I believe he was a
little afraid of fortune-hunters and wanted Joy’s
mind to mature before she met the breed.”</p>

<p>Bracknell nodded his understanding of the situation,
and then remarked. “The place is not without
its points&mdash;but to my thinking it has grave dangers
also. When Miss Gargrave returns to civilization,
the reaction from the hard life and the
solitude of the North is likely to be so great that
in the whirl she may be carried off her feet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Rolf Gargrave does not appear to have
thought of that. But there are others who have
it in mind.” The corporal looked thoughtfully at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
his companion, and wondered what relation he stood
to their hostess. It was a question that could not
be asked openly, but remembering how once or
twice the girl’s Christian name had slipped into
Rayner’s speech he guessed that whatever the
relationship was, it was a fairly intimate one. He
was still wondering when his companion rose.</p>

<p>“If you are ready, Corporal Bracknell, we will
go and look at&mdash;a&mdash;Koona Dick.”</p>

<p>The corporal rose with alacrity, and five minutes
later, clad in outdoor furs, they were moving briskly
down the road cut between the pines. As they
walked, the policeman looked about him with keen
eyes, and when they reached the point where the
narrower path that he had followed branched off,
noticed what had escaped him before, namely that
the path was evidently continued on the other side
of the road also. Rayner did not hesitate between
the two. He made a straight line for the path
which led to the place where Koona Dick had fallen.
As they turned into it, the thought that he might be
wrong appeared to strike him, and he halted
abruptly.</p>

<p>“This path, wasn’t it? The left going towards
the house, I think you said, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the left!” answered Corporal Bracknell
quietly, but as he walked by the other’s side the
question leaped in his mind. “Did I mention the
left?” He could not remember. He doubted, and
his doubts were strengthened by the fact that till
a moment before he had not known that the path
was continued across the main road. Thinking
there was only one path, there was no reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he should have mentioned the position of it. Yet
the man by his side had known which path to take!
As he walked on, he gave no sign, but a question
leaped up in his mind. “How did Rayner know?”</p>

<p>Then simultaneously he and his companion came
to an abrupt halt. At their feet in the snow was
a dark blot. The corporal looked hastily round,
then felt for his matches and struck one. As the
wood caught, he stooped and examined the ground
near the dark blot, where was the impress of a heavy
body in the snow, and footmarks all round it. He
stared at the trampled snow in amazement, then
he examined the snow in the shadow of the trees.
Its surface in the immediate neighbourhood was
unbroken, save by the print of a single pair of
moccasined feet, and those footmarks moved towards
the place where Koona Dick had lain, and
not away from it. He looked among the underwood
in the neighbourhood of the path. The
search in the darkness revealed nothing, nowhere
was there any sign of the man whom they had come
to look for.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Rayner in an odd voice.
“What has happened?”</p>

<p>“A strange thing has happened,” said the corporal
laconically. “The body we came to look for
has disappeared.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CORPORAL FINDS A LETTER</p>

<p class="drop-cap06"><span class="beg">“DISAPPEARED!</span>” As he echoed the corporal’s
word in a hoarse voice, Rayner
looked hastily and fearfully into the
shadows, and then added, “Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” answered Corporal Bracknell
tersely. “This is the place where he lay. That
is his blood in the snow there; and you can, see the
print of his body if you look.”</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;then he was not dead after all?” asked
Rayner in a strange voice.</p>

<p>“I would not say that. I would have taken my
oath that there was no life in him. I even felt
his heart!”</p>

<p>“But in that case, how has he got away?”
inquired Rayner quickly. “Dead men do not walk
away from the place where they die.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the corporal quietly. “But they
may be carried. It seems to me that there are
more footmarks here than there were when I came
on Koona Dick lying in the track; but I cannot be
quite sure of that, as I did not look about very
carefully.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the other a trifle critically.
“I should have thought that would have been the
very first thing that you would have done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“In ordinary circumstances it would,” was the
reply, “but I had left my team in the main track,
and to do that overlong is not wise. One might
get separated from it, you know. Also I had already
guessed that there was a homestead not very
far away, and it seemed the sensible thing to go
there first, and learn anything that I could that
would help in the elucidation of the mystery of the
dead man.”</p>

<p>“Um! And did you learn anything?”</p>

<p>“More than I expected.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” answered Rayner sharply. There
was a new note in his voice, and the corporal felt
rather than saw that the other was staring at him
in the darkness. “May I ask what that was?”</p>

<p>“It was that you were acquainted with Koona
Dick.”</p>

<p>“I have never spoken to him in my life,” replied
Rayner quickly.</p>

<p>“But you knew him or you had heard of him.
I saw you start when I mentioned his name at
table.”</p>

<p>His companion laughed uneasily. “You have
sharper eyes than I gave you credit for, Corporal
Bracknell. It is quite true that I had heard of
Koona Dick. I heard of him in my journey up,
and what I heard was not to his credit. Your presence
here implied that he was in this district, and
one had no hankering for such an unpleasant neighbour.”</p>

<p>“And Miss Gargrave, had she only heard of
him also?”</p>

<p>As he asked the question the aurora flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
suddenly in the Northern sky, and in its light reflected
from the snow the corporal saw that Rayner’s
face was white and troubled. The light
faded almost as suddenly as it flamed, and with
that look in his mind the policeman waited for the
answer to his question. It seemed to be an intolerable
time before Rayner spoke in a hoarse and
shaking voice.</p>

<p>“How can I tell you? If you feel that it is
absolutely necessary to obtain an answer to that
question, I can only suggest that you should approach
Miss Gargrave herself.”</p>

<p>In his heart Bracknell knew that this answer was
a mere evasion. Rayner knew more than he was
willing to confess, and the policeman wondered
what it was, and what link there was between him
and Miss Gargrave and Koona Dick. He considered
a moment, and then deliberately forced the
pace.</p>

<p>“I have not told you everything, Mr. Rayner. I
do not know what relation you stand to Miss Gargrave,
but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am her cousin,” interrupted Rayner, “and my
father is her guardian and lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” answered the corporal. “Then
there is more reason why I should tell you what
I intended to do. I have not told you yet how I
came to find Koona Dick. I had turned in from
the river because I smelt burning wood. I thought
that maybe the man I was after had encamped
somewhere in this immediate neighbourhood. I
found the avenue leading to North Star Lodge and
began to follow it. I turned from the main road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
into the wood on a fresh sled-trail which I imagined
and still imagine was Koona Dick’s. I had gone
only a little way, when, as I have already told you,
I heard two rifle shots and a woman’s cry in quick
succession to each other. I ran back to the road,
and after waiting a moment I began to follow it.
I had reached the point where this path cuts into
it, when happening to glance across I saw a woman
coming towards me across the snow. I halted in
the shadows, meaning to speak to her, but I caught
sight of her face, and she did not see either my team
or myself.”</p>

<p>“You saw her face&mdash;plainly?” interrupted his
listener quickly.</p>

<p>“Quite plainly.”</p>

<p>“And would you recognize it again?”</p>

<p>“I have already done so,” answered the corporal
quietly.</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the woman was your cousin, Miss Gargrave.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” cried Rayner, breaking into
discordant laughter. “You surely are not going
to charge Joy with shooting Koona Dick?”</p>

<p>The corporal was not disturbed by the laughter.
To his ears it sounded forced, and the contemptuous
protest in his companion’s words left him unmoved.</p>

<p>“There is one little thing that I have not told you,
Mr. Rayner, and to me it seems to be significant.
Miss Gargrave carried a rifle.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing strange or even significant
in that,” replied the other quickly. “My cousin is
an ardent sportswoman, and had probably been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
after game. Besides, as I told you, I think, there
are timber wolves about. They are dangerous
beasts in hard weather, and one does not go far
unarmed in this district.”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell answered these suggestions
by some of his own. “Miss Gargrave was running
down the path which led to this spot. To my
eyes she was plainly distraught, and I may remind
you that she fainted when I told you that Koona
Dick was dead.”</p>

<p>Rayner laughed again hardly. “You are persistent,
Corporal, but there is nothing in a girl
fainting when she is told rather dramatically that
a man has been shot dead almost at her own door.
Aren’t you a little imaginative? Indeed,” he
laughed again, “having heard a rifle shot have you
not imagined all the rest? I am told that a lonely
trail plays the deuce with a man’s nerves. You
say that you saw Koona Dick lying here, dead; but
he is not here&mdash;now, and he can’t&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I haven’t imagined that anyhow,” interrupted
Bracknell, pointing to the dark stain on the snow,
“and I haven’t imagined any of the other things
I have told you, either. Believe me, Mr. Rayner,
my nerves are in perfect order.”</p>

<p>Rayner stamped his feet in the snow. “Possibly!
But there is no need that we should freeze, whilst
we discuss the point, is there? I do not understand
police procedure, but if you have quite finished
here, I think we might return to the house. I
have no desire to lose my toes through frost-bite.”</p>

<p>“I can do nothing here, tonight,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Bracknell quickly. “I shall have to wait until
morning. I am quite ready to return.”</p>

<p>Rayner did not reply. Swinging on his heel, he
began to move in the direction of the lodge. The
corporal followed him in silence, and they had almost
reached the main-road when something light
caught his moccasined foot. He looked down and
discerned what looked like a piece of paper. Stooping
quickly, he picked it up, and crushed it in his
mitten, as his companion turned round, as if to wait
for him. At first he thought Rayner must have
seen him make the find; but as the other spoke, was
reassured.</p>

<p>“I hope you will not disturb my cousin unnecessarily
tonight, Corporal Bracknell.”</p>

<p>“I shall not trouble her at all, Mr Rayner.
There is no need that I should&mdash;yet.”</p>

<p>“Nor at any other time, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I share that hope, most fervently,” answered
Bracknell, with an earnestness that the other
evidently found convincing, for he did not speak
again until they were seated in the front of the
stove in the room where they had dined. Then
he tried to make light of the situation. “Corporal,”
he laughed, “the laws of hospitality are sacred
in the North. Even though you feel you must
drag us all down as your prisoners, they must be
honoured. We have some very old brandy here,
indeed it is incredibly old, and its quality is equal
to its age. You will take a glass with me, and another
cigar?”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted, thank you, Mr. Rayner.”</p>

<p>Rayner produced a decanter and glasses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
poured out the brandy, and whilst the officer was
lighting his cigar, Miss La Farge entered the room.</p>

<p>“How is Joy?” asked Rayner quickly.</p>

<p>“Better, thank you. She sent me to make her
excuses for tonight; and to ask how you had
sped.”</p>

<p>“Only fairly,” answered Rayner, with a smiling
glance at the corporal. “We did not find the dead
man whom Mr. Bracknell averred he saw.”</p>

<p>“That is very strange,” said the girl wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply, “very strange, so strange
indeed that I have tried to persuade the corporal
that all that he has told us is just a snow-dream.”</p>

<p>“But you have not persuaded him?” asked
Miss La Farge, with a quick glance at the corporal’s
face.</p>

<p>It was Bracknell himself who answered. “No,
I have not, as yet, been persuaded, Miss La
Farge.”</p>

<p>“My eloquence was wasted, Babette,” laughed
Rayner easily. “Corporal Bracknell has that
British stubbornness which is a nuisance to our
friends and a terror to our enemies.”</p>

<p>Miss La Farge laughed as she replied, “That is
a characteristic of the male persuasion.”</p>

<p>With a smiling nod she withdrew, closing the door
behind her, and Rayner rose from his chair and
drew a curtain of moose-hide over the door.</p>

<p>“Miss La Farge is a good companion for my
cousin.”</p>

<p>“From French Canada, I suppose?” queried the
corporal.</p>

<p>“Father was of that stock, but her mother was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
partly of Scotch descent, partly native. Joy’s
mother died young, and Babette’s brought them up
together. They are foster-sisters and inseparables.”</p>

<p>Bracknell nodded, and sipped the brandy thoughtfully,
and the other continued, “I do not know what
will happen when Joy gets married.”</p>

<p>“Is that an early possibility?” asked the corporal,
with a sudden quickening of interest.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied Rayner, with a bland smile.</p>

<p>The corporal made the inference that he was
meant to make. “Then you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is not quite settled yet, but I hope it will
be very shortly. The wilderness years necessitated
by her father’s will are nearly over, and I am to
take her ‘out’ from here. I hope then that we shall
be married, and live in England.”</p>

<p>For a moment the corporal did not reply. He
looked at the bland, mask-like face before him,
saw, as he had already noted, that the steel-like
blue eyes were too close together, that the lips were
sensual; and as he did so, the beautiful face of Joy
Gargrave, as he had seen it at table, rose before
him, and somehow he found Rayner’s suggestion
of coming wedlock utterly distasteful. The man,
as he felt instinctively, was not a man to be trusted
with a girl’s happiness. Why he should have that
feeling he could not tell; but it was there, and it
was only by an effort that he was able to reply
affably.</p>

<p>“For Miss Gargrave, England, no doubt, is much
to be preferred.”</p>

<p>“Much!” agreed Rayner, then added, “Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
told you so much, you can understand that I feel
rather inclined to resent your suggestion that Joy
has anything to do with the mysterious affair out
in the wood there. She may have heard the name
of Koona Dick as I myself have, but that she knew
him, that she shot him, is the very wildest thing
for any one to imagine. I really cannot think how
you can entertain it for a moment in face of the
utter absence of motive.”</p>

<p>“That is a strong point certainly,” conceded
Bracknell.</p>

<p>“That she happened to be in the neighbourhood
is nothing. I was in the neighbourhood, you were
in the neighbourhood&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted the corporal with a smile,
“that is true. But there is no reason why I should
shoot Koona Dick, and there was every reason why
I should take him prisoner.”</p>

<p>“You are not suggesting that there was any reason
why Joy or I should have done such a thing, I
hope?”</p>

<p>“Far from it. I know of none, but of course
in an area where crime is committed every one is
suspect until the criminal is found.”</p>

<p>Rayner laughed easily, and to the corporal’s
quick ear there was a note of relief in his tones as
he replied, “In that case there is no need why we
should worry, however one may resent the personal
implication of such a general suspicion.”</p>

<p>He pushed the decanter towards the corporal,
who shook his head, and rose from his chair.</p>

<p>“Thank you, no more tonight, Mr. Rayner.
If you will excuse me, I will go to my sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
quarters. I have had a very hard day, and must
be up betimes in the morning.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” answered Rayner, and a moment
later led the way to the bedroom which the policeman
was to occupy. For the North it was a luxurious
one, but the corporal scarcely noticed it. The
moment the door had closed behind Rayner, he
thrust a hand into his tunic pocket and drew forth
a crumpled piece of paper. It was the paper he
had picked up in the snow. He opened it out, and
as he caught a word or two of the writing it contained,
a swift light of interest came into his eyes.</p>

<p>Setting a chair in front of the stove, he seated
himself, and very carefully smoothed the paper on
his knee. Then he took it up and began to read.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pn1">“<span class="smcap">My dear Joy</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>“This note will no doubt be something of a
shock to you; as I imagine you must think I am
no longer in the land of the living; at any rate I
have not heard from you for a very long time,
and so can only presume that such must have been
your idea. But here I am and in a sweat to see
you.</p>

<p>“An accident gave me the knowledge of your
whereabouts, and now I learn that you are not
alone. Therefore I shall not visit the house, in the
first instance, without your invitation, but I must
see you, and in an hour’s time after your receipt
of this I shall look for you in the little path that
goes towards the hill. It is a long time since that
day at Alcombe, which I am sure you will not have
forgotten, and you and I, my dear, should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
much to say to each other. Do not fail to come.</p>

<p class="pr4">“Dick....”</p></div>

<p class="p1">When he reached the end, the corporal sat staring
at the letter like a man hypnotized. It was in
pencil, written on a page torn out of a memorandum
book, and the writer had evidently been about to
sign his full name, and then had changed his mind,
for the beginning of the surname had been crossed
out, and the more intimate “Dick” left to stand
alone.</p>

<p>“Then she did know him!” he whispered to
himself. “She went out to meet him. She&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not finish his utterance, but lifted the
paper the more carefully to examine the signature.
He was interested in the unfinished surname, and
spelled out the letters carefully, “B-r-a.” He
repeated them to himself several times, trying to
guess the sequence that should follow, then suddenly
he started to his feet, and a startled look came into
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he whispered. “If it should be
so?” He stood for quite a long time, his face the
index of profound thought and concern, then he
bestowed the incriminating letter in a place of
safety, and prepared for bed. But it was long
before he slept. From somewhere in the forest
came the long-drawn howl of a wolf, and in response
the dogs outside bayed in chorus, but it was his
own silent thoughts, and not these noises of the
wilderness, that kept sleep from his tired eyes.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">A PUZZLING SCENT</p>

<p class="drop-cap05"><span class="beg">THE</span> following morning Corporal Bracknell
was early astir, but early as he was there
were others earlier, for the smell of frying
moose-meat reached him before he was dressed.
When he left his room he found Rayner awaiting
him.</p>

<p>“You are early, Corporal,” was the greeting.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought of going out as far as the place
where we went together last night.”</p>

<p>“What! before breakfast? Surely there is no
need for such haste, and remember there will be
no daylight for at least a couple of hours yet.”</p>

<p>“That is so, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>An Indian servant appeared from somewhere in
the rear of the house, bearing a silver coffee-pot on
a tray. Rayner pointed to it with a smile.</p>

<p>“That settles the matter, I fancy. Breakfast is
being served. You will not allow it to spoil, I am
sure.”</p>

<p>“It is a convincing argument,” laughed the corporal.
“I will breakfast first and attend to duty
afterwards.”</p>

<p>Rayner nodded, and led the way into the room
where they had dined on the previous night. Places
were laid for four at the table, but neither Miss
Gargrave nor her foster-sister had yet appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are a little early for the ladies,” said Rayner,
seating himself, “but we will not wait for them.
They may breakfast in their room.”</p>

<p>The corporal took his place, and whilst they ate,
conversed with his companion in a desultory kind
of way. Both of them steadily avoided any reference
to the events and conversation of the night
before, and in the course of the meal the policeman
learned a little more about his hostess’ father.</p>

<p>“He was an odd kind of man,” explained Rayner,
when reference had been made to him. “Came of
a good stock in the Old Country, and was one of
the pioneers up here. A man of culture as a glance
round the bookshelves will show you, and a man
of business also. Some of the best mining properties
in the North were secured by him, and unlike many
of the Klondyke millionaires he made his home
here, and he bought, regardless of cost, the old
family estate in England. I think he meant to
return there, with his daughter, some day. But
the hard life of these wild lands had entered into
his blood, and he&mdash;”</p>

<p>The sound of a feminine voice outside caught the
officer’s attention, and made him neglect what his
companion was saying. He heard the outer door
open, and close, then hurried steps sounded in the
passage, and two people passed by the room in
which he was seated. The door happened to be
ajar, and the corporal saw that one was his hostess,
and that the other was her companion and foster-sister,
Miss La Farge. They were not late for
breakfast because they had dallied in their rooms;
they had been outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>As he realized this a little frown of thoughtfulness
puckered the corporal’s forehead. Why had
they been out at this early hour, and whilst it was
still dark? Rayner noticed his pre-occupation,
and guessing the cause of it, suavely offered an explanation.</p>

<p>“Apparently I was mistaken about my cousin
and Miss La Farge. They are not the sluggards
I thought they were. They have been outside
whilst I thought they were still a-bed.”</p>

<p>“They are very early,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Yes! There is a silver fox about, and Joy
has a line of traps. She hopes to get it. I understand
that its pelt is rare.”</p>

<p>“Much rarer than it used to be,” agreed the
policeman absently.</p>

<p>The explanation was a plausible one, but he did
not find it satisfactory. He suspected that
something other than a silver fox had taken Joy
Gargrave and her foster-sister into the woods in
the darkness of the morning. He wondered what
it was. Had his hostess missed the note which
he had picked up the night before, and had she
been out to look for it? He did not know, he could
only guess, and wait impatiently for the coming
of dawn.</p>

<p>As soon as the first leaden light showed through
the trees outside he left the house. Rayner offered
to accompany him; but the corporal declined the
offer.</p>

<p>“Thank you, there is no need, Mr. Rayner.
I shall be able to manage what I have to do
alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“You think I shall be in the way, Corporal?”
laughed the other.</p>

<p>“I did not say so,” answered Bracknell, “though
of course it is the simple truth that when one has
a knotty thing to solve, solitude and quiet are sometimes
helpful.”</p>

<p>He went out and walked quickly from the house
until he reached the by-path where he had made
his startling discovery of the night before. As
soon as he turned into it, his pace slowed, and he
walked with his eyes fixed upon the ground.
There were many footmarks in the snow, the
most of them stale, as was shown by the powdery
snow which had drifted into them. He recognized
his own tracks of the night before, going and coming
from the point at which he had found Koona Dick,
and there were others apparently made about the
same time, but those which arrested his eyes as
he turned from the main road were a pair of freshly-made
well-marked tracks, too small to have been
made by the feet of men. He nodded to himself
as he saw them, and began to follow them eagerly.</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes walking, he was a
little surprised to find that the double trail that
he was following, turned from the path into the
shadow of the trees. It was still almost dark
here, but as he stooped over the tracks, he became
aware of the fact which seemed to him to be full
of significance. There was a third pair of footprints,
not so recently made as the others, as the
powdering of snow in them showed, and the tracks
that he was trailing apparently followed them. He
stooped and with his hand made a rough measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the stale tracks, and of one set of the fresh
ones, with which they seemed almost identical.
They were the same size, and about the two sets
of impressions were little individual characteristics
which were immediately discernible to the trained
eyes.</p>

<p>“Following her own tracks,” he muttered softly
to himself. “Now, I wonder why?”</p>

<p>He could do no more than guess, and as that was
not a very profitable occupation he continued
his search. The trail that he was following went
but a little way into the forest, and then turned
outward towards the path again, and presently
reached a point at which he came abruptly to a
standstill.</p>

<p>Under a giant spruce, the lower boughs of which
had been cut away at some time or another, was
a medley of tracks, which called for detailed examination.
He stood regarding them for a moment,
and then he looked around him. As he did so
he saw that the trail, which he was following,
moved forward from the huddle of tracks by which
he had paused, and that they led into an open lane
in the trees. He looked again, took a step or
two forward, and then whistled slowly to himself.
He was looking at the place where the body of
Koona Dick had lain. The stained snow was
hidden by freshly drifted snow, the impress of
the body however was still visible, and standing
near it, Corporal Bracknell looked back. There
was a clear line of vision from the place where the
fallen man had lain to the great spruce in the
shadow of which was that huddle of tracks. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
went back to the spruce, bent over the trampled
snow for a little time, and then standing upright
looked towards the path. Then he nodded his
head.</p>

<p>“She stood just here,” he murmured thoughtfully.
“There’s the mark of her rifle-stock in
the snow, and those deeper tracks show that she
stood waiting a little time. Then when Koona
Dick came, she&mdash;But did she?”</p>

<p>As he broke off and asked himself the question
he remembered Joy Gargrave’s face as he had
first seen it when he entered the dining room at
the lodge. It had not looked like the face of a
girl who had quite recently shot a man, and though
he recalled it with that look of terror which it had
worn when he had first seen it, and again with
that troubled look in the eyes when he had explained
that Koona Dick was the criminal that he sought,
he felt that his reasoning and his reading of the trail
must somehow be at fault.</p>

<p>He stood considering the matter for a minute
or two, glancing now and again to the place where
Koona Dick had lain, and the frown which had
came upon his face deepened. Then he recalled
the note which he had picked up on the previous
night and the frown lightened a little.</p>

<p>“Of course!” he whispered to himself, “she
discovered its loss and came out here to look for
it.”</p>

<p>But had she shot the man whom he had hoped
to make his prisoner, the man who unquestionably
had written that note to her? He could not decide,
and as it was too cold to stand still for long together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
he began to walk in a rather wide circle round
the scene of the tragedy. Then he made a fresh
discovery. On the other side of the path he found
other footprints in the snow, and, following the
track, reached a point where the person who had
made them had quite evidently come to a standstill
behind a clump of bushes. Corporal Bracknell
looked through the screen of small branches, and
once more found himself in full view of the place
where Koona Dick had fallen.</p>

<p>The frown on his face deepened once more.
He carefully examined the footmarks behind the
bushes, and decided that they were at least some
hours old. Probably they had been made the night
before, and it was at least possible that the individual
who had made them had witnessed the tragedy
which had taken place.</p>

<p>He began to follow the footmarks from the
point at which they left the bushes, and had gone
but a little way when he found that the trail was
crossed by another almost at right angles, a trail
much more deeply marked and the first sight of
which told him that either the person who had
made it was of very heavy build, or had been bearing
a considerable burden.</p>

<p>Perplexed beyond measure he stared at this new
trail, then he looked round. The tall spruce alone
met his eye. The profound silence of the primeval
North was over all. There was no sound of life
anywhere.</p>

<p>“And yet,” he murmured to himself, “there
were quite a lot of people here last night. What
were they all doing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely had the words slipped from him when
he heard some one cough in the shadow of the
wood, a little to the left of him. At once his
bearing became alert. Moving silently from tree
to tree in the direction from which the sound had
come, he reached a point which gave him a view
of an open glade. In the middle of the glade a girl
was standing looking down at the snow. He
recognized her instantly. It was his hostess, Joy
Gargrave.</p>

<p>A minute or two passed and then the girl began
to move down the glade quickly. He waited until
she was out of sight, and himself walked to the
middle of the glade where Joy had stood looking
down at the snow. Instantly he saw what had held
her eyes. A dog team had been halted there.
The marks of the runners were visible in the snow,
even the places where the dogs had waited, half-filled
with new snow, were quite clear. His practised
eyes read the signs without trouble. The team
had entered the glade, had apparently waited there
a little time, and then had turned and departed
in the direction followed by his hostess. Impulsively,
he turned to follow also, but as he did so,
caught sight of footmarks debouching from the
trees in a direct line to the place where the sled
had been halted. They were deeply marked, and
as he recognized instantly were the same as those
which he had been following, when the sound of
the cough had attracted his attention. The person
who had made them had followed a devious path,
making for the glade.</p>

<p>He frowned to himself. The mystery was growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
deeper. But as no solution of the affair offered
itself to his mind, after a little delay he began to
follow the sled tracks down the glade, noting that
side by side with them, were the fresh tracks made
by Joy Gargrave’s moccasined feet.</p>

<p>The glade led out into the main road from the
river to the house, and the sled-tracks turned towards
the river, and then were lost in the hard-packed
snow of the road. But as the sled had manifestly
turned in the direction of the river, Corporal
Bracknell also turned that way, walking quickly
and keeping a sharp look-out on either hand for any
indication of the sled having turned aside.</p>

<p>To or three minutes’ quick walking brought him
in sight of the frozen river, and at the top of the
bank, seated on a fallen tree, he perceived Joy Gargrave.</p>

<p>Her back was towards him, and her bent head
and hunched-up shoulders were eloquent of dejection.
He moved towards her quietly, and as he
drew nearer a flutter of white caught his eye.
It was the corner of a handkerchief which the girl
was holding to her face, and apparently she was
crying. A quick sympathy moved him as he stepped
up to her, the snow deadening his steps.</p>

<p>“Miss Gargrave, you are in trouble. I wonder
if I can be of any assistance?”</p>

<p>Startled by the sound of his voice, the girl looked
up, and for one fleeting moment he had a vision
of the beautiful face, tear-stained, and of the blue
eyes full of trouble. Then the face was hidden
in the handkerchief again, and a succession of sobs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was the only answer vouchsafed to him. He
stood for a little while in silence, looking down at
the shaking shoulders. His own eyes filled with
sympathetic concern, then he spoke again.</p>

<p>“Please, Miss Gargrave. Let me help. I am
sure your trouble is very grave.”</p>

<p>At that she looked up again, her face expressive
of deep misery.</p>

<p>“I am in deepest trouble,” she said brokenly,
“I do not think that you or any one else can be
of help to me.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he urged. “At least let me try.”</p>

<p>She sat for a moment in thought, her eyes veiled
by the long lashes, then she lifted her head and
looked at him as if she would measure his quality.
Then she broke, out impulsively.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she cried, “I will trust you, I will tell
you all. Perhaps you can help me, at least you
can give me advice.”</p>

<p>“Then let us walk,” he said quickly. “You will
freeze if you sit there long.”</p>

<p>He offered her his hand, and as she took it,
their eyes met, and in the corporal’s there flashed
a new light, and as he turned and fell into step
at her side his heart was beating tumultuously, and
his blood was running as if heated with a generous
wine.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">A REVELATION</p>

<p class="drop-cap05"><span class="beg">JOY GARGRAVE</span> did not begin her story immediately.
For a full two minutes they walked
on, environed by the solemn pinewoods, and
enveloped in the strange, white silence of the North.
The corporal waited, and at last the girl spoke.</p>

<p>“You wonder why I was sitting on the bank,
crying?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied frankly. “I am wondering
why you should do that, though I may tell you
that I already have an idea.”</p>

<p>“You already have an idea?” the girl’s tones,
as she echoed his question, betrayed surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, and thrusting a hand inside
his fur parka, he produced the note which he had
found, and held it towards her. He saw from
her face that she recognized it, and he continued
slowly: “You see, I found this last night&mdash;not
far from the place where Koona Dick was lying.
I did not know to whom it had been written; and
if I had known, I am afraid duty would have
compelled me to read it. If I am not mistaken,
it was written to you; at any rate it bears your
Christian name.”</p>

<p>“It was written to me,” answered the girl quickly.
“It is mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the writer of it? Was he Koona Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell glanced at the note, and his
eyes were fixed upon the half-erased signature.
“Tell me,” he said, “what is Koona Dick’s name?&mdash;I
mean the second half of his name which he
had begun to write apparently from force of habit,
and then crossed out?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it will be something of a surprise
to you,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not so great a surprise as you think,”
was the reply. “I think I have already guessed.”</p>

<p>“His name is the same as your own, Corporal.
It is Bracknell!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the corporal in the tone of a man
who had found his thoughts confirmed. “Richard
Ascham Bracknell, of course.”</p>

<p>“You have the name perfect,” answered Joy
quietly.</p>

<p>“Of Harrow Fell, Westmorland, England?” inquired
the corporal.</p>

<p>“He was born there,” replied the girl, “and Sir
James is his father, as you are his cousin.”</p>

<p>The corporal walked on a few paces without
speaking, his eyes staring at a distant hill, and from
the vacancy of their gaze it was evident that he
was lost in thought. Joy Gargrave watched him
curiously, and, after a little time, she spoke again.</p>

<p>“You did not know&mdash;you did not guess until you
saw that note?”</p>

<p>“I had not the slightest idea. I knew that Koona
Dick was an Englishman&mdash;that was all. But when
I read the note last night, and recalled your acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
acquaintance with Harrow Fell and Sir James,
I suspected.”</p>

<p>“If you had known you would not have undertaken
to follow him&mdash;to take him prisoner, I mean?”</p>

<p>“I could not very well have refused, without resigning
from the force. Perhaps you know how
the oath of allegiance runs?”</p>

<p>Joy shook her head, and he quoted&mdash;”And will
well and truly obey and perform all lawful orders
and instructions, which I shall receive as such,
without fear, favour or affection of or towards any
person. So help me, God!”</p>

<p>The girl shivered a little. “It is a hard service,
yours,” she said. “And you would have arrested
your cousin?”</p>

<p>“My cousin, or any other man&mdash;or woman. I
have no choice in the matter. Duty, after all, is
the greatest word in the language.”</p>

<p>Joy considered him thoughtfully. His lean face
was stern, and there was a hard light in the unwavering
grey eyes. It was clear to her that he meant
just what he said, and that he would do whatever
duty dictated without fear or favour.</p>

<p>“It is not every one who would agree with you,”
she replied. “Your cousin, for instance, he&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he interrupted. “What was Dick
Bracknell to you? This letter suggests an intimacy
beyond that of mere acquaintance or friendship.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” the girl answered quickly. “He
was my husband.”</p>

<p>“Good God!”</p>

<p>As that expression of extreme amazement broke
from him, Corporal Bracknell halted abruptly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
looking at the beautiful girl by his side, with incredulous
eyes.</p>

<p>“It is quite true,” she said. “I am Koona Dick’s
wife&mdash;or widow.”</p>

<p>Still he did not speak, and watching him the girl
saw a flash of something like horror come into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“And you went to meet him&mdash;last night?” he
said, at last, in a shaking voice.</p>

<p>“I have not said so,” answered the girl quickly.
“You have read that note, but you must not surmise&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I saw you,” broke in the corporal quickly.</p>

<p>“You saw me?” It was Joy Gargrave’s turn
to be astonished, and as he looked at her it seemed
to him that fear was shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw you,” he answered mechanically.</p>

<p>“Where?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“You were coming out of the path between the
woods. You had a rifle in your hand. There was
a strange look upon your face. I was standing
with my dogs in the shadow of a spruce and you
passed me without seeing me. I was about to speak
to you, but the sight of your face kept me silent.
It was that, and the thought of two shots which
I had heard, which sent me along the path you
had just left to investigate. At the end of it, I
found Koona Dick!”</p>

<p>“Dead?” asked the girl sharply.</p>

<p>“He seemed so to me!” was the reply. “Indeed,
I was quite sure that there was no life left in him,
or I should have done my best to revive him, and
not have left him lying there in the snow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“If he were dead, where is he now?” came the
swift question.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied the corporal. “The
thing is a mystery to me. When I returned to the
place with Mr. Rayner last night the body had
already disappeared.”</p>

<p>“But how could it do that, if he were really
dead?” objected his companion.</p>

<p>“Some one must have removed&mdash;” Corporal
Bracknell stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>It was clear to Joy that some new thought had
just occurred to him. She saw that he was looking
at her thoughtfully, and she wondered what was in
his mind.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked quickly. “What are
you thinking?”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he countered, “did you see your
husband last night?”</p>

<p>“I did,” she answered frankly.</p>

<p>“And when I had said that Koona Dick was
lying dead in the snow, you left the table. You
went out of the room, and you did not return.”</p>

<p>He spoke like a man pursuing a thought which
seemed to him almost incredible, but which was
thrust upon him by force of circumstances, and the
girl divined what that thought was.</p>

<p>“You do not think that I went back?” she cried.
“You cannot think that I am responsible for the
disappearance?”</p>

<p>“It is a natural thought,” he answered, “though
I am loathe to believe it. You must remember that
I saw your face as you came out of the path; and
that the man was your husband, though apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
your friends do not know it. My cousin&mdash;your
husband&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! but you do not understand!” cried the
girl quickly. “You do not realize that I would
give all I have to know that the body of the man
who was my husband was still where you first saw
it. It is the uncertainty of the fact which troubles
and worries me, and not his death.”</p>

<p>“Not his death!”</p>

<p>“No!” was the almost appalling reply. “The
certainty of that would be like a deliverance.”</p>

<p>For a little time Corporal Bracknell stared at her,
too much amazed for speech. It was clear to him
that she was in deadly earnest and that she meant
every word she said. He wondered what marital
tragedy was behind her attitude, and was still wondering,
when she spoke again in a hard voice.</p>

<p>“You seem surprised,” she said; “you know
your cousin fairly well?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, nodding his head.</p>

<p>“Then you cannot suppose that I loved him,
even though he was my husband! No girl could
love Dick Bracknell when she knew him for what
he was, and any woman, married as I was, would
almost rejoice to know that&mdash;that she was released.”</p>

<p>“You do not know what you are saying,” protested
the corporal quickly. “You cannot realize
what implication your words may have to any one
who knows what I know. It would almost seem
that you had wished for Dick Bracknell’s death, and
that fact in view of the circumstances in which I
found him last night might assume a terrible significance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean that people might think I shot my
husband?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “At least many people
would ask that question.”</p>

<p>“And you?” inquired the girl. “You have asked
yourself that question?”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” replied Bracknell. “You must remember
that I saw you coming from the place where
he was lying.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what conclusion you have reached,”
said Joy, looking at him keenly.</p>

<p>“None,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>“You are in doubt, then?”</p>

<p>“I am very loath to believe what the circumstances
would seem to indicate,” answered the corporal
quietly. “As you must see, they are terribly
against you, and your visit to the place this morning&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know of that?”</p>

<p>“I saw you and Miss La Farge come in whilst
Mr. Rayner and I were at breakfast, and whilst
you were supposed to be still in your rooms. I
found your tracks in the snow.”</p>

<p>“And you cannot guess why I&mdash;why we went?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“We went to look for that note which you showed
me just now. I had meant to destroy it, and
missed it this morning. Then I remembered that
I had put it in my pocket last night, and naturally
concluded that I had lost it outside. That is the
explanation of the journey this morning. No one
here but Miss La Farge has any idea that Dick
Bracknell is my husband, and I did not want any
of them to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell was conscious of a sense of
relief. The explanation was so simple that he felt
it to be altogether true. But there were questions
that still required answering, and he proceeded to
ask them.</p>

<p>“I can well believe, that,” he answered slowly.
“I suppose Mr. Rayner was among them from
whom you wished to keep this knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply, given frankly. “I
did not wish him to know how foolish I had been.”</p>

<p>The corporal remembered what Rayner had
hinted as to his hopes of making Joy Gargrave his
wife, and the girl’s answer started fresh questions in
his mind. Did she love Rayner and favour his
aspirations, and knowing herself to be already a
wife, had she deliberately removed the barrier
which lay between them, but of which Rayner had
no knowledge? He could not tell, and looking
steadily at the girl he proceeded to ask his next
question.</p>

<p>“Miss Gargrave&mdash;I mean Mrs. Brack&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No! No!” interrupted the girl. “Do not give
me that name. I do not want it. I hate it.
Call me Gargrave.”</p>

<p>He bowed. “As you please, Miss Gargrave.
There is a question I wish to ask you. Tell
me, did you have speech with Dick Bracknell last
night?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>“But you saw him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed quietly. “I saw him.”</p>

<p>“You stood in the shadow of the trees at a point
which would give you a clear view of the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
where you knew your husband would be waiting
for you, and you took a rifle with you. Why did
you take that rifle, Miss Gargrave?”</p>

<p>As he asked that question he saw the pallor of
the beautiful face grow more pronounced. The
frank blue eyes wavered, and for a second or two
he thought she was going to faint. Then she drew
a quick, gasping breath.</p>

<p>“You know these woods,” she said unsteadily.
“There are wolves and&mdash;and bears. To carry a
rifle is the merest prudence.”</p>

<p>A frown came on the corporal’s face. He knew
that the answer was a mere evasion, and he was
not pleased. But he did not challenge the answer
directly.</p>

<p>“Miss Gargrave,” he asked, “were you afraid of
Dick Bracknell?”</p>

<p>“Not afraid, exactly,” was the reply candidly
given, “but I loathed him, and hated the thought
of his coming into my life again.”</p>

<p>The corporal considered for a few seconds, and
then asked his next question bluntly.</p>

<p>“Tell me, did you fire your rifle at all whilst you
were out, or whilst you were waiting for your
husband?”</p>

<p>As he made the inquiry the girl came to a sudden
standstill, her lips trembling, her pale face working
strangely, the blue eyes expressive of awful fear.
He waited in far more distress than his impassive
face indicated, and at last the answer came in a
shaking whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. But, oh, believe me, I&mdash;I did not
know that I had done so till afterwards. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
know what happened.... I saw him fall in the
snow, and I waited. Then I went up to him. He
seemed to be dead&mdash;and after that I must have fled
homeward.”</p>

<p>As he listened the corporal visioned the tragedy
of the night before, and as he looked into her
troubled face, his heart smote him. His voice was
almost sympathetic as he asked the next question.</p>

<p>“You say you saw your husband fall? Was it
after your rifle was discharged or before?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;do not know,” the girl replied. “This
morning the whole thing is like a disordered nightmare
dimly remembered. I know there was a
moment when I was tempted to wickedness.
There was a terrible hatred in my heart for my
husband, and as I saw him standing there, it flashed
on me how easy it would be to free myself from
him for ever. It was only a moment&mdash;like a sudden
madness, and then I saw him drop in the snow....
I do not know what happened, but this morning I
examined my rifle.”</p>

<p>Her voice quivered and failed, and suddenly she
bent her face in her mittened hand and broke into
a storm of weeping. The corporal himself was
greatly moved by her distress, but the sight of it
somehow relieved his worst fears.</p>

<p>“Miss Gargrave,” he said hopefully, “you examined
your rifle this morning. Tell me what
you found?”</p>

<p>“An empty shell in the chamber,” said the girl,
sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said quickly, a touch of excitement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
his manner, “and in the magazine? Tell me,
quick.”</p>

<p>“There was a full clip&mdash;but for the shell which
had been fired.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Bracknell with a sigh of relief. “I
thought so. Now think carefully, and tell me, did
you hear another shot fired?”</p>

<p>The trouble in the girl’s face cleared suddenly,
and a light of hope flashed in her eyes. “Why do
you ask?” she cried. “I thought I did, but this
morning I could not be sure. I thought it might
be the echo of my own rifle&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was not an echo,” interrupted the corporal
quickly. “It was the discharge of a rifle. I was
a little distance away, and I distinctly heard the
reports, one so close on the heels of the other that
the two seemed almost like one.”</p>

<p>Wonder mingled with the hope in the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“You are sure,” she cried. “Yes! Then there
must have been some one else, some one who fired
at my husband, and perhaps I did not kill him after
all. Oh! thank God! Thank God! I hated him,
and though I was tempted, it was only a flaming
moment of madness, from which I was saved. You
think that? Say you think that, Mr. Bracknell?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” answered the corporal reassuringly,
“I feel convinced of it. At first, I was doubtful,
and will own I suspected you. But your frankness
in the matter has set the whole affair in a new
light.”</p>

<p>A thoughtful look came on his face. For a full
minute he stood there without speaking, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
girl watched him, wondering what was in his mind.
Then he spoke again.</p>

<p>“The affair is very mysterious. There certainly
were two reports and one only came from your
rifle. It is evident to me that a third person was
in the neighbourhood when your husband was shot.
I have found the place where he stood, and I was
following the track of a sled, when I came upon
you just now. The track is a fairly recent one,
made, I should say, no later than last night.”</p>

<p>“Possibly it was my husband’s team,” suggested
the girl.</p>

<p>The corporal nodded. “That of course is just
possible, but the man who took it away cannot
have been Dick Bracknell. If he were not dead&mdash;and
I am sure he was&mdash;he certainly was in no
condition to walk away. And the team did not
go away of itself, for there is the track of a man’s
feet, both going and returning.”</p>

<p>“If he should not be dead&mdash;” faltered the
girl. The corporal looked at her, and the sight
of her distress moved him to a deeper sympathy.
He knew his cousin, and Koona Dick’s record in
the territory was not an attractive one. He wondered
how this beautiful girl had been induced to
marry Dick Bracknell, and frowned at the thought
that if he were not dead, she was still his wife. The
girl noticed the frown.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking, Mr. Bracknell?”</p>

<p>“I was wondering however you came to marry
such a scally-wag as I know Dick Bracknell to have
been.”</p>

<p>Joy Gargrave flushed and then grew pale. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
am not surprised that you should wonder....
If you will walk on I will tell you how&mdash;how it
happened.”</p>

<p>Without speaking he fell into step by her side,
and waited for her to begin.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CORPORAL HEARS A STORY</p>

<p class="drop-cap07"><span class="beg">A LITTLE</span> time passed before the girl spoke,
and Corporal Bracknell, to avoid embarrassing
her, looked steadily at the snowy
waste ahead. The frozen river, bordered by the
sombre pinewoods, was visible for some two miles,
and where it turned round a high rampart of the
cliff, a moving figure, clearly visible on the snow,
caught his eyes. He watched it attentively as it
came to a halt, and wondered idly who it might be.
A wandering Indian possibly, or&mdash;The girl’s
voice broke on his speculations.</p>

<p>“I met your cousin first, whilst I was staying
in the neighbourhood of Harrow Fell. There was a
shooting party, and Dick Bracknell made himself
very agreeable to me. You are to understand that
I was rather lonely, and that I was new to English
ways, having lived most of my life up here.”</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and Corporal Bracknell
nodded.</p>

<p>“I think I understand how you must have felt,
Miss Gargrave, and I know that Dick could make
himself attractive.”</p>

<p>As he spoke his eyes looked in the direction of
the bluff where the river turned. The small black
figure which he had observed was moving again,
and if he were not mistaken was coming down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
river. He kept an observant eye upon it, whilst
his companion resumed.</p>

<p>“You are quite right. All the vacation, which I
spent in Westmorland, your cousin was very attentive
to me, and knowing that he was Sir James
Bracknell’s heir, I was flattered by his attentions,
and a little proud that he should find me attractive,
when there were others who&mdash;who might have
meant more to him.”</p>

<p>“You were too humble, Miss Gargrave,” said the
corporal.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I was,” replied the girl, smiling wanly.
“But that is how I felt at the time.... At the
end of the autumn, just before I went back to
Newnham for the Michælmas term, he proposed to
me.”</p>

<p>Again for a moment she was silent, and the corporal
glancing at her caught a pensive look upon
her face, and guessed that she was reviewing that
occasion in her mind. He waited for what seemed
quite a long time, then he said encouragingly,
“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I did not accept him then.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“For two reasons; the first because I was not
quite sure that I loved him, and the second because
I was not prepared to take such a step without first
consulting my father.”</p>

<p>“They were both very excellent reasons.”</p>

<p>“So they seemed to me, but Lady Alcombe, under
whose care I was whilst in England, did not agree
with me.”</p>

<p>“You were under the care of Lady Alcombe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an accent of surprise in the young
man’s voice, which the girl was quick to note.</p>

<p>“You know her?” she asked quickly. “You
are surprised that I should have been under her
chaperonage?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted frankly. “I know Lady
Alcombe, and I know her set. It is a fast and
exclusive one. I am a little surprised that any one
should have selected her to chaperone a young girl.”</p>

<p>“My father did not understand,” was the quick
reply. “He had known Lady Alcombe before her
marriage, and she was a distant relation of ours.
He did not know the set to which she belonged, and
it was perhaps natural that he should have looked
to her to watch over me.... For myself, I was
young, I had no experience, and though there were
things that I did not understand, things that shocked
me, I did not mention them to my father, or indeed
to any one.”</p>

<p>“And Lady Alcombe approved of my cousin
Dick?”</p>

<p>“She did. She laughed at my scruples, and
urged me to accept him, declaring that my father
would be only too ready to see me the wife of a man
who would some day be the Squire of Harrow Fell.
But I did not yield&mdash;then. I knew there was
plenty of time, and as my father was expecting to
visit England a few months later, I said that I would
wait until he arrived.”</p>

<p>“And afterwards?” asked the corporal.</p>

<p>“Afterwards!” A tragic look came on the girl’s
face, and to his surprise she broke again into tears.</p>

<p>He waited patiently, and as he did so noted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the figure up the river was certainly drawing nearer.
After a little time the girl recovered her composure,
and when she resumed there was a tragic note in her
voice.</p>

<p>“I was very ignorant, and your cousin and Lady
Alcombe presumed upon my ignorance. I was to
stay with her at Alcombe Manor for the Christmas
season, and towards the end of the term she sent
word that she and Dick were going to fetch me by
car, as the rail journey was rather an awkward
one.... When the day came, your cousin showed
up alone, explaining that Lady Alcombe had an
attack of influenza which, of course, had made it
impossible for her to accompany him. It was all
so natural that I thought nothing of it until afterwards,
and I set out on the journey accompanied
only by your cousin.”</p>

<p>A stern look came on the corporal’s face, though
the girl, looking straight ahead and absorbed in her
thoughts, did not notice it.</p>

<p>“We missed the way, and went astray, I say
missed the way, though now I am quite sure that it
was done of deliberate purpose, and that your cousin
knew our whereabouts all the time. It began to
snow, and late in the evening we reached a little
village in Wiltshire when something went wrong
with the engine. I do not believe now that there
was anything at all the matter with the car, but
Dick said there was, and as it was impossible to
proceed further, and there was no train service on
the little local line five miles away, there was nothing
for it but to stay the night at the little inn, half
tavern, half farm, which was all the accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that the village afforded.... There was a motherly
woman there who did her best to make me comfortable,
and I shared a room with her two daughters,
whilst your cousin was accommodated with a
settle in the kitchen. Next morning, Dick tinkered
at the car, and about noon we started afresh, and
reached the Manor just before dinner time....
Lady Alcombe, who had apparently recovered from
her influenza, was in a great state of perturbation,
and when I entered the hall, where a number of
guests were assembled, she rushed to me. ‘My
dear Joy,’ she cried, ‘where <i>have</i> you been? I
have been worried almost to death about you, and
have been telegraphing and telephoning all over the
place.’</p>

<p>“I laughingly explained, and whilst I was doing
so, one of the men gave a whistle of surprise, and a
girl whom I had never liked began to giggle. Lady
Alcombe allowed me to finish my explanation, there
before all her guests, then she said icily&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘After so many adventures you must be tired.
You had better go to your room. I will come to
you.’</p>

<p>“As I went, I knew there was something wrong
somewhere. One or two of the men looked at me
in an unpleasant way, and the girl whom I have
mentioned was giggling hatefully.... Lady Alcombe
came to me before I had changed, and
ordered the maid out of the room, then she said,
‘My dear Joy, you have behaved most indiscreetly....
I do not know what to say ... what to
think. And to tell a story like that before all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
people not one of whom will believe it! It is dreadful,
positively dreadful!’</p>

<p>“I was bewildered. I did not know what was
wrong, and I said so, adding that I had only told
the simple truth.</p>

<p>“‘They will not believe it,’ she said. ‘You and
Dick will be the talk of the place. I really do not
know what to say. I am surprised at Dick Bracknell,
and at you for being so simple as to tell....
That Jolivet girl was openly laughing at you.’</p>

<p>“Her tone and manner told me better than her
words the vile thing she was hinting at, and when I
realized it, I broke down and cried.”</p>

<p>She paused, and as the corporal recalled what
Lady Alcombe was, and visioned that scene between
the fast woman of the world and the innocent girl
in her care, he ground his teeth, and looked away
from the beautiful face which was working with
emotion.</p>

<p>“... When I did that Lady Alcombe changed
her tone. ‘There’s only one thing to do,’ she said,
‘and that is to make the best of it. Thank goodness!
Dick is over head and ears in love with you,
and, as you know, he is only too anxious to marry
you. You will have to take him now&mdash;to save your
good name, Joy. It is the only way, for no one will
believe your story, however true it may be, and so
I advise you to make up your mind to the inevitable....
Things might be a great deal worse. Dick
will be a baronet some day, and his wife will have a
position that no one will challenge. Just think it
over, my dear, and you will see that I am altogether
right.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did think it over,” said the girl slowly, “and
in the end I agreed to marry Dick privately, making
up my mind to explain the matter to my father,
later. What else was there that I could do? I had
no suspicion of anything at the time. Dick wanted
me, and I liked him, whilst there were people at
Alcombe who did not fail to let me see what they
thought, and Lady Alcombe did not stint persuasion.”</p>

<p>“When did you find out that the delay in arriving
at Alcombe was anything but an accident?” asked
the corporal thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“On the very morning I was married. We had
returned from the church, just Dick and myself and
Lady Alcombe, and I was in the library writing a
note to a friend at Newnham, when I heard two
people enter. The library is a little draughty, and
a footman had placed a screen for me, and this completely
hid me from any one entering at the door.
The two who entered were Lady Alcombe and Dick.
I heard her laugh and say&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘You owe me five thousand pounds, Dick. I
hope you won’t be very long in paying, for the truth
is, I am beastly hard up, and I daren’t ask Sir Alfred
for a penny at the present time.’</p>

<p>“Dick laughed also, and I caught his answer.
‘As soon as that old duffer in the Klondyke makes
his settlements I’ll pay you, Mary. You deserve
it. That was a pretty little scheme of yours, and
it has gone like clockwork....’</p>

<p>“It came on me like a flash then. I saw how
everything had been arranged, and how I had been
trapped and hustled into marrying your cousin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
In that moment I hated him, and I have done so
ever since.... I sat there too startled to make
my presence known, and after a little time they
went out, without learning that I had overheard
them. I continued to sit there thinking. I scarcely
knew what to do. It was arranged that we were
to go to Paris for the honeymoon; and I was afraid
that they would somehow make me accept that
arrangement, and bewildered though I was, I was
determined that I would not do so, that I would
never allow Dick Bracknell to be in fact what he
was in name.... I went to my room, secured my
travelling coat and some money, and fled from the
house, without leaving so much as a note to indicate
where I was going&mdash;I went to Cambridge to the
friend to whom I had been writing, and who was
staying there reading through the vacation. I told
her everything, and on her advice wrote to Lady
Alcombe, explaining the situation, and averring
that I would never live with Dick Bracknell. In
reply I got a telegram from him saying that he
would be down to see me the next day, and praying
me to grant him an interview. He never came.
Something happened and he had to leave England.
Do you know what it was? I have never heard.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the corporal slowly. “I know,
and I think it is only right that you should know.
You knew perhaps that Dick was in the Artillery?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” answered the girl.</p>

<p>“He was interested in his job. He was a good
officer. It is the one thing to his credit that I know.
There was a new gun, and he had access to the plans.
He stole a copy, and sold them to the agent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of a foreign government. The theft was discovered
and traced, but a friend dropped Dick
a telegram which was forwarded to Alcombe Manor&mdash;and
he ran for it, and got clear away. I imagine
that explains why he did not visit you at Cambridge.
Of course, the affair was hushed up, as such affairs
are, and it is nearly forgotten now, though England
would not be a safe place for him. Did you ever
hear from him afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Not until last night,” was the reply. “When
his note came to me, it was a great shock.”</p>

<p>The corporal nodded. “I can readily imagine
that it would be.... Did your father ever know
of your marriage?”</p>

<p>“No, thank God! I wrote to him, but before
he received the letter the accident occurred by which
he lost his life. I found the letter here unopened,
when I came here to comply with the terms of his
will. I was glad to get here. I was so overborne
by the deceit and vileness of those I had thought
were my friends in England!”</p>

<p>“They were not all deceitful, surely?” expostulated
the young man.</p>

<p>“No! Some are my friends still. I am going
to England very shortly, and I shall stay with one
of them in Westmorland.”</p>

<p>“Will you ever return here?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly. North Star is my home&mdash;I
love it, and I have always felt myself safe here&mdash;until
last night.”</p>

<p>Bracknell understood that she meant that she
had felt that in this lodge in the wilderness she was
safe from his cousin, and nodded his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“I understand,” he said, but forbore to add what
was in his mind; namely, that if Dick Bracknell
had not died on the previous night, North Star
would be no longer the sanctuary it had been.</p>

<p>They walked forward for a moment without
speaking. A rise in the ground covered with snow-laden
saskatoon bushes hid the river from them for
a little time, and as they breasted it, and the river
came into view again, they surprised a pedestrian
climbing up the bank. It was Mr. Rayner.</p>

<p>He was obviously a little startled by the meeting,
but a moment later recovered himself.</p>

<p>“Been out for a constitutional,” he explained,
“as far as the bend of the river, and I’ve had quite
sufficient. Are you ready to return?”</p>

<p>The girl nodded, but the corporal, whose eyes
were surveying the empty landscape in front, shook
his head.</p>

<p>“I shall walk on a little,” he said, “I may be going
up stream tomorrow. The Elkhorn falls in somewhere
about here, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Just beyond the bluff there,” answered Joy.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take a look at it, and see what the
trail is like.”</p>

<p>He nodded and walked on leaving Joy Gargrave
to return with Rayner. He waited until they were
out of sight and then descended to the frozen surface
of the river, where the going was easier, the
trail having been packed by prospectors moving up
and down. He reached the bluff in a short time,
but did not go round it. His gaze was arrested by
the trail of a sled which had come down the bank
to the river at a point just below the bluff, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
recent footmarks. He remembered the figure he
had seen whilst walking with Joy Gargrave, unquestionably
that of Rayner, for there were his footmarks
turning south from the bluff. A thought
struck him, and examining the snow carefully, he
found no tracks running northward. A little puzzled
he looked at the sled trail again, and there made
the discovery that the single footmarks that ran side
by side with the sled-trail, had been made not by
one pair of feet but by two, some one having quite
recently adapted his stride to the tracks already
made. Puzzled and interested he followed the sled
trail up the bank and began to trace it through the
wood at the top.</p>

<p>An hour later, still following the sled-trail he
struck the river again, and found himself exactly
opposite the landing which led to North Star Lodge.
As he realized this he nodded thoughtfully. The
sled trail he had been following, when he had
encountered Joy Gargrave, led directly across the
river. But whose sled was it? And why had
Rayner traced it so carefully, at the same time endeavouring
to cover his own trail? The first question
was one for which he had no answer, and the
second was an equal puzzle. Clearly Rayner had
been interested in the sled-trail since he had followed
it for two miles; and plainly he was anxious to conceal
his interest, since he had walked so carefully
in the footsteps of the unknown driver, and had
made no reference to the matter whatever. Did
he know something&mdash;something that he did not wish
to make known?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The corporal thought that very likely he did,
but could not even conjecture what the secret
knowledge might be. There was a puzzled frown
on his face, as he turned in the direction of the
Lodge, and when he came in sight of the house he
became aware of a considerable bustle. In the
open space in front two sleds were drawn up, and a
considerable number of dogs were lying about or
nosing in the snow for lost fragments of food. Two
Indians and a half-breed were standing near the sleds
smoking and talking. Bracknell recognized the
half-breed for a man who had been in the service
of the police as a driver.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Jacques,” he asked, “what brings you to
North Star?”</p>

<p>Jacques grinned responsively. “I bring a letter&mdash;I
and dese, Co’pral. Yees two dog teams to
deleever one petite lettre. But we take sometings
else back weeth us, I tink.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” laughed the corporal. “What may
that be?”</p>

<p>“I tink we take a lady, de lady of North Star!”
The corporal gave vent to a whistle of surprise, and
after a few more words passed into the house.
There he met Mr. Rayner, who smiled at him.</p>

<p>“We have news for you, Corporal. We start
for England tomorrow. A message has just
reached us from my father, and Miss Gargrave’s
presence is urgently required on a matter of business.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think we shall all be glad to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
away. That mysterious affair of last night would
be rather a disturbing thing to reflect upon in a
lonely place like this.”</p>

<p>The corporal nodded, made some casual remark,
and passed to his own room, where he sat for quite
a long time, smoking, with a very thoughtful look
upon his face.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">JOY MAKES A REQUEST</p>


<p class="drop-cap15"><span class="beg">AFTER</span> the mid-day meal, at which Joy Gargrave
did not appear, Corporal Bracknell
left the house, and strolled down the road
until he reached the place where the girl had passed
him on the previous night. There he came to a
standstill, his brow puckered in thought, then he
swung to the right into the same path where he had
found Koona Dick lying in the snow. He had gone
but a little way however, when a noise behind him
caused him to look round. Joy Gargrave was following
him. He waited for her, and as she came
up to him she said, “Mr. Bracknell, do you mind if
I accompany you a little way? I should like to talk
to you&mdash;if I may.”</p>

<p>“It will be a pleasure, Miss Gargrave,” he
answered quite sincerely.</p>

<p>“Then if you do not mind we will turn aside into
the wood. I&mdash;I do not care for this path, now, and
we might be seen and interrupted by some one, and
I have a request to make of you.”</p>

<p>“I am entirely at your service, Miss Gargrave.”</p>

<p>“Then we will turn&mdash;here.”</p>

<p>She indicated a place where the wood thinned a
little, and turning with her, he fell into step at her
side, and waited for her to begin, wondering what
she might have to say to him. Half a minute passed
in silence, then she began abruptly: “You will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
heard that we are starting for England tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “Mr. Rayner told me.
The decision is rather sudden, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “The journey is a quite unexpected
one, just now. We had thought of waiting until the
ice broke up and of canoeing down the river. But
a letter has just come from Sir Joseph&mdash;Mr. Rayner’s
father&mdash;stating that my presence is required in
England at the earliest possible moment. The letter
has been delayed, and Mr. Rayner tells me that it
is requisite that we should start at once.”</p>

<p>“The business must be very urgent if you have
to start on such a long journey at a day’s notice,”
commented the corporal.</p>

<p>“It is not altogether that,” was the reply,
“though Mr. Rayner insists that it is imperative
that we shall make an early start. The truth is&mdash;”
she broke off, and then resumed in a quavering
voice: “I am much upset by that mysterious affair
of last night, and, Mr. Bracknell, I am afraid&mdash;horribly
afraid.”</p>

<p>“Of what?” he asked, looking into her beautiful
face to find it white and tense with emotion.</p>

<p>“Of my&mdash;my&mdash;of Dick Bracknell,” she answered
quietly.</p>

<p>“But if he is dead, what&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you think he is dead?” she cried sharply.
“Tell me, Mr. Bracknell, what do you really
think?”</p>

<p>“Last night,” he answered slowly, “I had no
doubt whatever about it. But today&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, today?” she prompted anxiously.</p>

<p>“I am not quite so sure. His complete disappearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
perplexes me. If he were dead as I
thought, then some one has carried his body away;
and if he were not dead, then some one must still
have helped him, for he was in no condition to help
himself.”</p>

<p>“That is what you think? Mr. Bracknell, do
you know that there was a sledge in the wood to the
left of that path?”</p>

<p>“I saw the trail,” he answered quietly, “and I
saw you following it.”</p>

<p>“Whose sled was it?” she asked thoughtfully.
“It was none of ours, and it was not yours, and it
could not be that of a miner, for any such would
have come to the Lodge, as we keep open house for
the men on trail.”</p>

<p>“I do not know whose it can have been,” answered
the corporal thoughtfully. “If we knew
that we should have the key to the whole of this
mysterious affair, possibly. But whoever it was he
was anxious as far as possible to cover his tracks.
He did not follow the trail up the river. He crossed
to the track on the other side, and then turned off
into the wood; he lit a fire there. I found the ashes
after I left you this morning. He must have halted
there for a little time, for the snow was pretty well
trampled, and when he resumed his journey, he
marched parallel with the river, and descended to
the ice again just south of the bluff. I found his
tracks coming down the bank there, and I imagine
that from the point he must have followed the trail
up-river.”</p>

<p>“Whoever could he be?” asked the girl in perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not know. But tomorrow I am going to
find out; my dogs will be fresh then, and after the
rest I shall be able to travel fast. Of one thing I
am convinced: whoever the man was he was not
your husband. Dick Bracknell, as I said just now,
was in no condition to help himself, certainly not to
take the trail.”</p>

<p>For a moment Joy Gargrave did not speak, and
as he looked at her he wondered what her thoughts
were. He was still wondering when she broke the
silence.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bracknell, I am afraid, terribly afraid.
Somehow I feel that your cousin is not dead. I feel
that he will come back here, and that is why we are
hurrying away tomorrow morning. The letter
from Sir Joseph Rayner serves for an excuse. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p>“I think I do,” answered the corporal sympathetically.
“You are afraid that Dick, having found
out where you are, will return to worry you?”</p>

<p>“You know him, I have told you how I was
trapped into marrying him, do you think that he
is the man to leave me in peace?”</p>

<p>“He is likely to consult only his own interests,”
agreed her companion.</p>

<p>“But I shall be safe from him in England, if what
you tell me is true. He dare not go there openly,
and if he were to appear at all, I should be able to
protect myself, by invoking the police.”</p>

<p>“The police would only be too happy to afford
you protection here,” answered the corporal earnestly.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with grateful eyes. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
mean yourself. Yes! I know, but there is another
service that I want from you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You have but to name it, Miss Gargrave,” he
answered as she hesitated. “So far as duty allows,
I am entirely at your service. Tell me what it is
that I can do for you.”</p>

<p>“You can find out for me whether Dick Bracknell
is alive or dead.”</p>

<p>The corporal had not anticipated the request, and
he was a little startled by it. Instantly his mind
reverted to the conversation he had had with Rayner.
He recalled the hopes which the latter
entertained, and wondered if this white-faced girl
at his side was willing to help their realization. As
that possibility flashed into his mind, he was conscious
of a constriction about his heart. But he
gave no sign.</p>

<p>“I should be compelled to do that in any case,”
he answered quietly. “I cannot relinquish the
work on which I started until I know what has
become of the man who is known at headquarters
as Koona Dick. Some one must know about him&mdash;probably
the driver of the sled whose trail I followed,
and I’ve got to find out. Vague reports are
not regarded as satisfactory by the heads of the
force.”</p>

<p>“You will let me know?” she asked instantly.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to do so,” he answered quietly,
and again he was conscious of the tightening about
his heart.</p>

<p>“You see,” she explained, “my position is so
anomalous. All my little world with the exception
of my Newnham friend and yourself, my foster-sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
whom I told only last night, thinks of me
as a spinster.”</p>

<p>“You are sure Mr. Rayner does not know of
your marriage?” asked the corporal quickly, as a
thought struck him.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure,” answered Joy readily, without
giving any indication that she found any special
significance in the question. “You see the part
played by Lady Alcombe was not very credible,
and I used my knowledge of it to ensure her silence.
I wrote to her and told her that if the wedding was
not kept secret, I should proclaim all that had
happened to the world. Her vulnerable spot is the
position she holds in society, and she knew how that
would suffer if it became a matter of common
knowledge that for a bribe she had schemed to
marry to a scamp an innocent girl left in her charge.
She wrote me a short note in reply, in which she
said, that she would forget that the marriage had
even taken place, and that I need not fear that it
would ever become known. That is why I am so
sure Mr. Rayner does not know. Lady Alcombe
dare not betray me.”</p>

<p>Bracknell nodded. “I dare say you are right,
but of course you cannot marry again until you are
sure of that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do not want to marry again!” interrupted
the girl quickly, the blood flaming in her pale face.
“Why should you think that I do, Mr. Bracknell?”</p>

<p>As the corporal met her blue eyes, clear and
unshadowed by guile, his heart grew suddenly light,
and on the moment he dismissed from his mind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
thought that Joy Gargrave in any way shared Mr.
Rayner’s aspirations. He laughed cheerfully as he
replied, “I did not say that I thought you wished
to marry again, Miss Gargrave. I was merely
stating the law on the matter, and there is no personal
significance to be attached to such a statement.”</p>

<p>Joy Gargrave smiled austerely. “I am not
likely ever to marry again,” she said. “Once
bitten, twice shy, you know.”</p>

<p>The corporal smiled in return, but as he marked
her loveliness and remembered the figure at which
the Northland had estimated Rolf Gargrave’s
wealth, he thought to himself that many a man
would endeavour to persuade her to a different
mind, but he did not say so.</p>

<p>“Miss Gargrave, one never knows what the future
holds&mdash;but whatever happens you can count me
as your friend. I am not proud of my relationship
to Dick Bracknell, even though it does make me
some sort of a cousin to you. There is nothing
that I will not do to serve you, and if anything that
I learn will deliver you from your anomalous position,
you may rest assured that I will let you know
of it at the earliest possible moment.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Bracknell,” she answered
simply. “I shall be very grateful.”</p>

<p>They walked on a little way without speaking,
then she turned to him suddenly. “You are my
cousin, more or less, Mr. Bracknell, but I do not
know your christian name.”</p>

<p>“It is Roger,” he answered smilingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“And if at any time I want to communicate with
you, where&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Headquarters at Regina. That will always
find me sooner or later, no matter what part of the
Territory I may be in.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to know that,” she said, “and if at
any time you have news for me, any letter sent care
of Sir Joseph Rayner will reach me.” She turned
in her steps as she spoke. “I think I had better
return now. There is much to do at the Lodge,
and they will miss me. But I am glad to have met
you, and glad to think that I can count you among
my friends.”</p>

<p>She held out her mittened hand, and as he took
it Roger Bracknell felt the blood surge warmly in
his face, and in his grey eyes as he looked at her
there was a flame that had she observed it would
have told her that she had secured more than a
friend. But she did not see it, and as she walked
away there was a pensive look on the beautiful face.</p>

<p class="p2">The next day Corporal Bracknell, with his own
team ready harnessed, watched Joy Gargrave and
her escort take their departure. Four full teams of
dogs drew their equipment, and snow having fallen
during the night, Joy and her foster-sister wore the
great webbed snowshoes of the North. They
stood making their good-byes, then the half-breed
driver gave the word.</p>

<p>“Mooch! Mooch! Linka!”</p>

<p>The leading dog gave a yelp, and strained at his
collar, and a moment later all the teams were moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
southward. Joy Gargrave waved her hand as
she moved on, and he waved back and stood watching
till the cavalcade was out of sight, then turning
to his own dogs, he gave the word to move and set
his face towards the snowy solitudes of the North.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">KOONA DICK</p>

<p class="drop-cap15"><span class="beg">AS HE TRAVELLED</span>, Roger Bracknell’s mind was
busy with the events of the past two days,
and with the information he had gathered.
That his cousin Dick should have turned out to be
the man whose trail he had followed had occasioned
no wonder after the first shock of surprise; but the
mystery of the attack upon him, and of his subsequent
disappearance, afforded him much food for
thought. Some one had determined that Dick
Bracknell should die, and some one had shot him.
The question was&mdash;who was it? He had dismissed
from his mind any idea that Joy herself had any
complicity in that business, her frankness having
quite killed the suspicions he had at first been inclined
to entertain.</p>

<p>His thoughts swung round to Rayner. Did he
know anything of the matter? He could find no
satisfactory answer. It was true that immediately
after the crime he had seen him entering the Lodge
with a rifle, and he had certainly shown a keen interest
about the sled which had waited in the wood,
but from the first he had casually offered a sufficient
explanation, and the instinct which turns every man
into an amateur detective on the occasion of a mysterious
crime would easily account for the second.</p>

<p>Besides&mdash;Rayner could have had nothing to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
with the disappearance of Dick Bracknell’s body,
for the corporal was quite sure that he had never
left the house until he had done so with himself.
True, he had betrayed a certain knowledge as to
the place where the crime had been committed, but
he himself might easily have communicated that
knowledge to Rayner, though he could not recollect
having done so, whilst on the other hand, the motive
for such a serious crime as murder was not immediately
apparent. It was true that Rayner designed
to marry Joy Gargrave, but that of itself was not
a sufficient motive unless he knew of the previous
marriage.</p>

<p>“But does Rayner know of that marriage?”
He uttered the question aloud, and answered it the
same way, speech helping him to precipitate his
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I think not! The girl is so positive ... and
Rayner has given no sign. There’s the deuce of a
coil to be unwound somehow.”</p>

<p>He reached the bluff, turned it, and saw the
junction of the tributary Elkhorn with the main
river. When he reached it he halted his dogs and
made a careful inspection of the trail. The new
snow had drifted, but the thick pinewood which
grew on the banks of the smaller stream had turned
the snow in places, and about two hundred yards
up, he came on the half-obliterated traces of sled-runners.
He examined them carefully, stood for
a minute or two in thought, then nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Turned up here out of the main trail, and will
probably have made a camp somewhere. Anyway
it is worth trying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>He went back for his dogs, and turned up the
Elkhorn. The trail at first was not very bad, and
he made a good pace; but after the first two miles
it worsened, and he struck an abundance of soft
snow, presenting an absolutely virgin surface. This
made the going very hard, and he marched ahead
of his labouring dogs, packing the snow with the
great webbed shoes of the North, lifting each foot
clear almost perpendicularly, then planting it down
to harden the surface for his canine team. Three
miles or so he made, in spite of the cold, sweating
like a bull, and then he reached a place where the
wind had swept the ice like a broom leaving it almost
clear of snow.</p>

<p>He examined the frozen surface, and after a
little search found the marks of sled-runners on the
ice. He searched further, but found nothing save
these twin scars running parallel to one another.
But one sled had passed that way, and he was sure
that he was on the right track. A smile of satisfaction
came on his lean face, and seating himself,
on the sled he swung forward at a rattling pace.</p>

<p>The short day was coming to a close when the
leading dog yelped suddenly, and with his followers
began to manifest signs of canine excitement.
Roger Bracknell himself sniffed the keen air.
There was a fire somewhere, for the unmistakable
odour of burning resinous wood reached his nostrils.
He stepped off the sled, and hanging on to the gee-pole
tried to check the pace of his team. His
efforts however, were in vain. The dogs bent their
heads to the ice and threw themselves against the
collars, hurrying forward, as they had not hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
all day. They too smelt the burning pinewood,
and to them it signified not merely human habitation,
but freedom from the traces, and the frozen
salmon which constituted their evening meal.</p>

<p>The corporal, finding his endeavours to restrain
them vain, prepared for eventualities. Hanging on
to the sled with one hand, with the other he unfastened
the holster wherein he carried his service
pistol. He did not know what to expect. That
aromatic odour might come from an Indian tepee,
from the hut of some lonely prospecting party, or
from the camp of the man he was following; in any
case it was as well to be prepared.</p>

<p>The leading dog yelped again, and the others
responded in joyful chorus. The team swung suddenly
towards the left bank, up a slight incline
towards a clearing in the wood. Out of the gathering
gloom a faint glow appeared, and then the
shadowy outline of a hut. The glow was from
a frosted parchment window, and the hut was the
typical miner’s cabin of the North. Corporal
Bracknell smiled and dropped his hand from the
pistol-holster, finding the look of the place altogether
reassuring. The dogs came to a standstill
on the packed snow in front of the cabin, yelping
delight, and whip in hand Bracknell waited, listening.
If there were dogs at the cabin they might be
expected to charge the new-comers, who fastened in
the traces would be heavily handicapped. The
charge he waited for did not come. There was no
challenging answer to the yelping of his own team,
and apparently the owner of the cabin was without
dogs, or if he owned a team it was absent from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
home. This fact further reassured him and threw
him still more off his guard. He stepped forward
to the door of the cabin and rapped upon it with the
butt-end of his dog-whip.</p>

<p>“Come in,” answered a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>The corporal felt for the moose-hide thong that
worked the wooden catch, opened the door, and
stepping inside turned to close it behind him.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the voice again. “Now put
your hands up.”</p>

<p>The corporal jumped and his hands moved instinctively
towards the holster as he swung round.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” snapped the voice. “Put them up,
or by&mdash;” Bracknell recognized the folly of resistance,
and as he raised his hands above his head,
his eyes swept the cabin for the speaker. A
slush lamp against the wall, and the glow from the
roaring Yukon stove gave light to the middle of the
cabin, but the corners were in comparative darkness,
and it was a second or two before he located
the owner of the voice. Then, in a bunk in the
corner furthest from the door, he caught sight of a
man propped among furs and blankets. On the
edge of the bunk rested a hand which held a heavy
pistol pointing at himself. The face that he looked
into was that which he had last seen in death-like
repose in the snow near North Star Lodge&mdash;the
face of Koona Dick. The eyes of the latter glittered
wickedly in the firelight, and whilst the officer
waited the voice spoke again, mockingly.</p>

<p>“The end of the long trail&mdash;hey, bobby?”</p>

<p>The corporal did not reply. Apparently his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cousin was alone and comparatively helpless, or he
would scarcely have waited his entrance lying in
the bunk. His eyes measured the distance between
them and he speculated what chance there was of
the success of a sudden spring proving successful.
But the man on the bunk evidently divined what was
passing through his mind, for a second later he
broke the silence again.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t try it, officer, not if I were you. I
may be a sick man, but I can still shoot.”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell looked at the hand resting on
the edge of the bunk. It was perfectly steady. He
recognized the hopelessness of any attack proving
successful, until the sick man was off his guard, and
nodded casually.</p>

<p>“I give you best,” he answered, speaking for
the first time.</p>

<p>The man on the bunk gave a chuckling laugh.
“You seem wise,” he replied, “and if you do just
what I tell you you’ll prove you are. You’ve got
a gun, of course, in that holster of yours? Well,
when I give the word, you will unbuckle the belt,
and fling it pistol and all under the bunk here. No
tricks, mind you. If your hand strays an inch from
the buckle, I fire, and I warn you that I am a dead
shot.... Now you can get to work.”</p>

<p>The corporal dropped his hands to his belt, and
as his fingers worked at the stiff buckle, wondered
if he might run the risk of trying for his pistol.</p>

<p>“Quick! You’re too long!” cried the man in
the bunk. Roger Bracknell hesitated for a second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
His fingers fumbled at the buckle, then the belt
swung loose in his hands.</p>

<p>“Throw it!” came the command in a peremptory
voice.</p>

<p>The corporal threw it along the floor and it slid
to the edge of the bunk, then his cousin laughed
again.</p>

<p>“‘Wisdom is justified of her children.’ If you
had a pious upbringing, bobby, you will recognize
the Scripture. And now having got rid of your
arsenal, you can sit down at the table, and put your
hands upon it. That will be easier for you than
standing there trying to touch the roof, but I warn
you again&mdash;no monkey tricks or&mdash;”</p>

<p>The pistol moved significantly, and the corporal
moved towards the rough table, constructed out of
a packing case.</p>

<p>“Keep your hands up, and shove that stool forward
with your feet.”</p>

<p>The “stool” referred to was a log of wood, which
as the corporal recognized, would prove a very good
missile if a man had time to lift and throw it. Evidently
his mentor realized that also, and was taking
no chances, so, still at the pistol point, Corporal
Bracknell pushed the log forward to the table, and
then on his captor’s instructions seated himself
with his arms resting on the table.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the sick man, with a short laugh,
“we can talk in peace.”</p>

<p>“Talk away,” answered the corporal cheerfully.</p>

<p>“I will,” replied the other sharply. “There’s a
question that I want to ask you.... Why did you
pot me in the wood at North Star Lodge three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
nights ago? That sort of thing is against the rules
of your service, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It is,” answered the corporal, “and the answer
to your other question is that I didn’t pot you.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t, hey? Then who the devil did?”</p>

<p>“I would give a goodish bit to know,” was the
corporal’s reply. “The thing is a mystery to me.”</p>

<p>“But it’s no mystery to me,” answered the other,
a trifle passionately. “You did it, and it’s no use
trying to bluff me. I know you’ve been on my
track for weeks, and that you were determined to
get me by fair means or foul. If you think that
lying is going to help you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am not lying,” interrupted Roger Bracknell.
“I give you my word of honour that I am telling
you the truth&mdash;and I say that not because I am
afraid. It is true that I was trailing you, and that
I was close at your heels at North Star. But I
never shot you, I found you lying in the snow, as I
thought, dead, but I’d nothing whatever to do with
the shooting.”</p>

<p>“The devil!” cried the sick man, and from his
tones the corporal knew that he was convinced.
“Then who did it?”</p>

<p>The corporal saw a chance of further surprising
his questioner&mdash;and took it.</p>

<p>“Well, there was the person whom you went to
meet&mdash;your wife, you know.”</p>

<p>“My wife!” There was amazement in Dick
Bracknell’s tones, and for a moment after the exclamation
he stared at the officer like the man who
could not believe his ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, your wife, Joy Gargrave,” answered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
corporal steadily. “You went to meet her in the
wood, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell did not reply. His lips pursed
themselves and he began to whistle thoughtfully to
himself the while he stared at the man whose question
he left unanswered. The corporal smiled a
little, and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>“I should think that you would be the first to
admit that Joy Gargrave was not without grievances
sufficient to warrant extreme action on her
part.”</p>

<p>“You can put that notion out of your noddle, at
once,” replied the other harshly. “If you know
Joy at all, you know that the idea of shooting me
is the very last thing that would enter her head.
She’s not that sort.”</p>

<p>The corporal remembered Joy’s confession and
smiled whimsically at the unconscious irony of her
husband’s testimony, then, still trying to move the
other to some indiscretion of speech, he answered
quietly, “You believe in Joy Gargrave? But have
you thought what she must feel like? There are
plenty of women who&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Drop it,” broke in the sick man harshly. “The
motion is preposterous. I won’t listen to it; and I
warn you, I don’t share Joy’s scruples about shooting.”</p>

<p>“Nor about anything else, I imagine?” answered
the corporal with a short laugh. “But we can
easily settle whether Joy did it or not. Which side
did the shot come from?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re asking me something,” answered
the wounded man. “There were two shots, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
they came from both sides of me. It was a regular
ambuscade, and whoever fired meant to get me.”</p>

<p>“Where were you hit?” asked the corporal.</p>

<p>“Left shoulder! Drilled clean through,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“And which way were you facing when the thing
happened?” asked the corporal. “Think carefully.
It is rather important.”</p>

<p>“I was facing up the path, with my back to the
main road. I had heard something moving and
had turned round, just at the moment.”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” answered the corporal emphatically.
“It was the shot from the left that did for
you, and your wife was on the right.”</p>

<p>“But who was on the left? Tell me that if you
can, my Solomon.”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell shook his head. “There you
hit one of the mysteries of this business. I don’t
know, I wish I did, but as sure as my name is Roger
Bracknell&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As sure as what?” The interruption came like
a pistol shot, and the wounded man leaned forward
with amazement showing in his face. “What name
did you say you called yourself?”</p>

<p>“Roger Bracknell!” answered the corporal
quietly.</p>

<p>“H’m!” responded the other, peering at him
thoughtfully, then he said suddenly, “Take off that
chapeau of yours!”</p>

<p>The corporal removed his fur cap, and sat with
it in his hand, whilst the other searched his face
with inquisitive eyes. There was a moment’s silence,
and then the wounded man spoke again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“It beats the band. You are my cousin Roger
right enough, and this is a nice dramatic meeting.
Drury Lane isn’t in it with us, though what the
blazes you are doing as a ‘Mounter’ beats me. I
thought you were at the bar.”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t know you were Koona Dick until
three nights ago. I had your description given me,
and that cut across your cheek bone was particularized.
That and the beard you wear are acquisitions
since the old days at Harrow Fell, and even
when I looked at your face the other night I never
associated Koona Dick with Dick Bracknell.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to know?” asked the other
curiously.</p>

<p>“I picked up that note which you sent to your
wife asking her to meet you, and naming the place.
You had begun to write your surname and then
crossed it out. That gave me the first inkling that
you and Koona Dick were one and the same, and of
course when I talked to Joy Gargrave I knew that
what I suspected was the fact.”</p>

<p>“And knowing what you now know, you would
still arrest me?”</p>

<p>As he asked the question, Dick Bracknell leaned
forward a little, and the hand that held the pistol
hung loosely over the edge of the bunk. The corporal
noticed it, and shifted his grip on the heavy
fur cap in his hand.</p>

<p>“I should be compelled to. Duty is duty&mdash;you
know.”</p>

<p>“But, man, I’m your cousin!” came the protest.</p>

<p>“Yes! more’s the pity.”</p>

<p>As he replied, the corporal’s arm moved suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and the fur cap was jerked across the room
right into the sick man’s face. The corporal himself
followed it like lightening, and, as he reached
the bunk, gripped his cousin’s pistol-hand. The
weapon went off, once, twice, and the bullets plugged
the logs of the cabin, whilst Dick Bracknell shouted
imprecations. The policeman caught the barrel
of the pistol, and turned it away from himself,
whilst with the other hand he caught his cousin’s
wrist, and dug his thumb into the sinews of it, in
order to force him to release his hold. In the midst
of the struggle there was a sudden clamour of dogs
outside, but neither of the men noticed it. The
pistol cracked again, and at that moment the door
opened, and an Indian rushed in. Apparently, he
took in the situation in a glance. There was a
heavy dog-whip in his hand, and in an instant he
had swung it, and brought the loaded stock down
on the corporal’s head. The latter did not even cry
out. He doubled up like a doll out of which the
stuffing had been ripped, and lay in a crumpled
heap upon the hard mud floor.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HUSKS OF THE PRODIGAL</p>

<p class="drop-cap03"><span class="beg">WHEN</span> Roger Bracknell came to himself,
he had a splitting head, and no exact
recollection of recent events. His head
ached so much that he felt moved to press his temples
with his hands, but found that it was impossible
to do so, owing to his arms being bound to his
side. On making that discovery, he lay quite still,
with his eyes closed, thinking over the situation.
Little by little memory came back to him, and he
remembered what had befallen, but his remembrance
of events ceased with the moment when his cousin’s
pistol had cracked for the third time. Had the
bullet struck him? He did not know, but at that
moment through the drums throbbing in his head,
a voice sounded in his ears, a voice that had external
reality, and the tones of which he recognized.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s dead, Joe? He lies still
enough.”</p>

<p>A guttural voice grunted some reply, and there
was a sound of movement near him. He opened
his eyes, to find himself looking into a dark, frost-scarred
face, from which a single eye gleamed
malevolently. As that eye encountered his, the
dark face was lifted and turned from him, and he
caught the reply given over the speaker’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Him eyes open. He alright!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s good hearing. I don’t want him to die
on our hands, at least not until I have had a little
more conversation with him.”</p>

<p>The man Joe gave a careless reply, and moved
away. Corporal Bracknell craned his neck a little
and looked round.</p>

<p>The slush lamp was still burning, but through the
parchment window the grey light of the Northland
day penetrated, from which fact he deduced that
he had lain where he was many hours. In front of
the stove, the man of the evil face, whom he had
seen on opening his eyes, was busy preparing a
meal, and the odour of frying moose-steak and bacon
filled the cabin. In the bunk, propped up
among the furs, with his left arm in an improvised
sling, he descried his cousin, puffing at a pipe, and
regarding him with thoughtful gaze. Their eyes
met, and Dick Bracknell smiled.</p>

<p>“Morning, Cousin Roger. I hope that head of
yours is not very bad.”</p>

<p>“It is only middling,” answered the corporal
truthfully.</p>

<p>“Um! I suspected so! Joe there,” he indicated
the Indian bending over the stove, “doesn’t
know his strength, and he’s a holy terror with a
whipstock. You should see him tackle a big wolf
dog that’s turned savage. It’s a sight for gods and
men!”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell did not reply. He had not been
aware of the Indian’s entrance on the previous
night, but in a flash he divined what had happened
to him, and why his head ached so intolerably. His
cousin continued with mocking affability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“He hit you rather hard, I am afraid, but we
Bracknells are all a little thick in the skull, and I
hope no real harm will follow on Joe’s forceful
intervention. In any case you must own that his
arrival was a most opportune one.”</p>

<p>“I can well believe you found it so,” answered
the corporal.</p>

<p>“I did, Roger my boy, I did. You surprised me
last night. I didn’t think you would have gone for
a wounded and disabled man. It was scarcely
chivalrous, you know.”</p>

<p>“You were armed,” was the reply. “I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell waved his pipe airily. “We will
let it pass. What is done is done, and the past is
always to be reckoned as irrevocable, as I know
better than most of the parsons. The present and
the future are my immediate concern, and the question
is what am I to do with you?”</p>

<p>“That,” answered the corporal quietly, “is
scarcely for me to decide.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied his cousin with a little laugh, “but
it is a question in which you should be interested.”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell was interested, intensely interested,
but he strove his best to appear unconcerned,
and after a moment his cousin continued&mdash;</p>

<p>“Joe there has a very simply solution. He suggests
another knock on the head, and sepulchre in
the river through an ice-hole. It is a course that
would be advantageous to me, since your body
would not be found before the ice breaks up in the
spring, if then, and in the interval we should have
time to clear out of the Territories.”</p>

<p>The corporal knew that what he said was true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and shivered a little as he contemplated the suggested
way of getting rid of him, but his voice was
firm as he asked casually, “Why don’t you accept
that solution?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t I accept&mdash;” began the other, and
then broke off, glowering at the man who though
in his power was apparently undismayed. Then a
sneer came on his face. “Blood is thicker than
water,” he remarked. “Though you’re willing to
forget that we are cousins, and regardless of family
ties are prepared to follow your d&mdash;d sense of
duty, I can’t forget it; and I’m inclined to spare
you, and even to cut those bonds of yours on conditions.”</p>

<p>“On conditions! What are they?” asked the
corporal.</p>

<p>“That you give me your word of honour that you
will not attempt to escape or to attack Joe or myself
whilst you are with us.”</p>

<p>The corporal wondered what was in his cousin’s
mind and what was behind the offer, but he was
careful not to probe into the matter openly.</p>

<p>“You will accept my word of honour?” he asked
with a faint touch of surprise in his voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered his cousin sneeringly. “You
see, I know you of old. The Bracknell strain runs
true in you, whilst it has a twist in me. I know
you won’t break your parole&mdash;if you give it. And
of course, you will give it. It’s your word or your
life. Ha! Ha! Quite a Dick Turpin touch there,
hey?”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell considered the matter swiftly.
So far as he could see there was nothing to gain by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rejecting the offer, since he was completely in the
other’s hands, and though his cousin sneered he was
clearly quite in earnest.</p>

<p>“I might be disposed to give my word, if&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Man,” broke in the other savagely, “you had
better. There are no ifs and buts about it. Look
at Joe there. He doesn’t strike you as one who will
be over delicate, does he? If I let him loose you’ll
be running down the Elkhorn under the ice inside
ten minutes. You’d better agree&mdash;and quickly.
No!” he lifted his pipe to check the words on the
corporal’s lips. “Hear me out. There’s another
condition yet, and it is this. As soon as I am able
to travel you will accompany me without demur for
four days. On the fifth day, I’ll release you and
you can do your worst.”</p>

<p>The corporal hesitated. There was something
here that he did not understand, and again he
wondered what lay behind the proposal. His
cousin watched him, and as he did not speak, addressed
him again.</p>

<p>“I may remind you what the situation is. You
are in my power. If you can’t give me your word,
if I don’t fall in with Joe’s more primitive suggestion,
I can keep you tied up here, and I can leave
you tied up when we move on; or I can lash you on
to a sledge, and, willy nilly, take you along with us.
That must be quite plain to you. But I prefer an
amicable arrangement.... You will give me your
word?”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell recognized the truth of his
cousin’s utterances. There was little choice in the
matter, and after a little more reflection he agreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Dick, I give you my word of honour.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would!” Dick Bracknell laughed
shortly as he spoke, and then turned to his Indian
companion. “Just take your knife, Joe, and cut
those thongs.”</p>

<p>The Indian turned from the stove and growled
something in a dialect which the corporal did not
understand. He guessed, however, that the Indian
was demurring, and with mingled feelings waited
to see what would happen. His cousin spoke again,
and this time there was a peremptory note in his
voice.</p>

<p>“Cut those thongs, I tell you; and don’t stand
there growling at things you don’t understand.”</p>

<p>He added something in his native tongue, and
watching the Indian’s scowling face, the corporal
saw the frown lift, and a flicker of evil laughter leap
into the single eye. A moment later the Indian
stepped up to him, and with a hunting knife cut
the hide thongs which bound him, and then returned
to the stove.</p>

<p>The corporal stretched his arms, then his whole
body, and after that rose slowly to his feet. His
cousin watched him with eyes that smiled inscrutably.</p>

<p>“Feels better, hey? You’re a sensible man,
Cousin Roger, and now I guess we shall get along
famously. A pity, though, that I shan’t be able to
sit down to breakfast with you.”</p>

<p>“What I can’t understand is how you come to be
here at all,” blurted the corporal.</p>

<p>“Oh,” laughed the other, “that’s as simple as
you please. When I was plugged down by North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Star, I must have lapsed into unconsciousness&mdash;for
the first time on any stage. Whilst I was lying
there in the snow&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I examined you,” broke in the corporal. “I
thought that you were dead!”</p>

<p>“But as you see I wasn’t,” replied the other,
“and whilst I was lying there in the snow; Joe,
who was waiting with the dogs, having heard the
shots came to look for me. He carried me to the
sled, took me to the woods on the other side of the
river, made a fire, and having doctored me brought
me along here. He’s a good sort is Joe, though his
looks are against him.”</p>

<p>The corporal did not reply. From the trails he
had found in the snow, he had already guessed part
of the story which he had just heard and was not
surprised at it. The wounded man laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“Joe is attached to me. I once did him a service,
and if I told him to do it he’d run amuck
through Regina barracks without demur. He
doesn’t love the mounted police, as he owes his
lost eye to one of them, so you will see, cousin,
that only my family affection saves you.”</p>

<p>The Indian turned his scarred face from the stove,
and laid the table in primitive fashion. Then
having attended to his master, he placed a tin plate
with moose meat and beans before the corporal,
filled a mug with steaming coffee, and with a grunt
invited him to eat. The officer did so readily
enough. He had eaten nothing for fourteen hours
and was feeling hungry.</p>

<p>“Plain fare,” commented his cousin, “but
wholesome, and if one brings to it the sauce of
hunger, it’s at least as good as anything we had at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Harrow Fell.... And that reminds me, cousin.
How is the governor?”</p>

<p>The corporal remembered the dignified Sir James
Bracknell as he had last seen him, and although he
had had his own quarrel with him, felt resentment
at the tone in which the question was asked.</p>

<p>“He was very well when last I saw him,” he
answered stiffly.</p>

<p>“How long ago is that?”</p>

<p>“Two years.”</p>

<p>“Um! that’s a goodish time. May I inquire if
he knows your whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“I think not. I didn’t tell him of my intentions
when I came here. We&mdash;er&mdash;had a difference of
opinion.”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell laughed. “I don’t blame you
for that. He’s a starchy old buffer is the governor,
and a regular perambulating pepper pot.” He was
silent for a moment, and then he inquired jerkily,
“How&mdash;a&mdash;did he take&mdash;that&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;little affair
of mine?”</p>

<p>“You mean the selling of the plans of the Travis
gun?”</p>

<p>“There’s no need for you to be brutal!” was the
sharp reply. “I’ve paid pretty heavily for that
piece of madness. You’ve to remember that I’m
the heir of Harrow Fell, and that if I show my nose
in England I shall probably get five years at Portland
or Dartmoor.”</p>

<p>The corporal knew that this was true, and was
conscious of a little compunction. Without alluding
to it he answered the question. “Sir James
took that very badly. It was hushed up, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
but when you disappeared, and your name was
gazetted among the broken, he pressed for an
explanation, and got it. As you can guess, proud
old man as he is, it wasn’t a nice thing for him to
hear.”</p>

<p>“No.... Poor old governor!”</p>

<p>A strained silence followed, and a full two
minutes passed without any one speaking. Then
the corporal glanced at his cousin. The latter was
sitting in his bunk, staring straight before him, with
a troubled look in his eyes. He moved as the
corporal looked at him, and as their eyes met, he
laughed in a grating way.</p>

<p>“The husks are not good eating,” he commented,
“and I’ve been feeding on them ever since the day
I skipped from Alcombe.”</p>

<p>The corporal was still silent, a little amazed at
his cousin’s mood, and the other spoke again.
“Don’t you go thinking I never regret things, Roger
my boy. There never was a prodigal yet who
didn’t lie awake o’ nights thinking what a fool he’d
been. And for some of us there’s no going back
to scoop the ring and the robe and to feast on the
fatted veal.... There are times when I think of
the Fell, and hear the pheasants clucking in the
spinney. And I never sight at a ptarmigan but I
think of the grouse driving down the wind on
Harrow Moor. Man&mdash;it’s Hell, undiluted.”</p>

<p>The corporal pushed the tin plate from him.
He felt strangely moved. He had thought of his
cousin as wholly bad, and now he found good
mingled with the evil. He turned round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dick, old man,” he said in an unsteady voice,
“you might make good yet, if you tried.”</p>

<p>His cousin laughed harshly. “Not me, you
know better. What were you after me for?
Whisky-running? Yes! I thought so. That’s
bad enough for a man of&mdash;a&mdash;my antecedents.
But there are worse things credited to Koona Dick,
as you’ll learn. I’ve got too far. What is it that
fellow Kipling says? ‘Damned from here to
Eternity’? That’s me, and I know it.”</p>

<p>“You can pull up!” urged the other. “You can
make reparation.”</p>

<p>“Reparation!” exclaimed the other. “Ah! you
are thinking of&mdash;Joy&mdash;my wife, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the corporal simply.</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell’s mood changed swiftly.
“What’s Joy to you?” he demanded hoarsely.
“You know her, you’ve talked with her, consoled
her, I don’t doubt. What’s she to you?”</p>

<p>As he spoke his tones became violent, and he half
threw himself out of the bunk, as if he would attack
his cousin. The Indian started to his feet, and his
one eye glared at the officer malevolently. The
corporal did not move. As his cousin shouted the
question the blood flushed his face, and in his heart
he knew that he could not answer the question with
the directness demanded.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Dick,” he replied quietly. “I
never saw Joy Gargrave till four days ago, and if I
talk of reparation, well, you’ll own it is due to her.”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell’s jealous passion died down as
suddenly as it had flamed. He threw himself back
in the bunk and laughed shakily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” he said, “but it is one of
the things that can’t be done.”</p>

<p>“You could let her divorce you!” blurted out the
corporal. “It would be the decent thing to do.”</p>

<p>“When did I ever do the decent thing,” retorted
his cousin sneeringly. “No, Joy’s my wife&mdash;and
I’ll keep her. It is something to know that there
are millions I can dip my hands in some day, and a
warm breast I can flee to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not now at any rate,” broke in the corporal
sharply, only by an effort restraining himself.
“Joy has started for England.”</p>

<p>“For England&mdash;when?” Dick Bracknell’s face
and tones expressed amazement, but his next words
were burdened with suspicion. “You’re not lying
to me?”</p>

<p>“No, it is the truth. Joy started for England
yesterday morning. I saw her start.”</p>

<p>“And I can’t follow,” commented the prodigal
bitterly. “That’s part of the price I pay.”</p>

<p>He did not speak again for a long time, and the
corporal charged his pipe, lit it, and sat smoking,
staring into the stove, and reflecting on the mess his
cousin had made of his life.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour the Indian went out,
and then Dick Bracknell broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I wonder what Joy thinks of me? Did she tell
you?”</p>

<p>“She knows how she was trapped&mdash;you are
aware of that, of course? I think she will never
forgive you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not surprised,” was the reply, “and yet,
Roger, I think the world of her. When I married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
her I loved her&mdash;and I wasn’t thinking of her
money overmuch. It was Lady Alcombe who put
that rotten scheme in my head. If I’d only been
patient, and run straight, and not been tempted by
that agent to sell the secret of the Travis gun&mdash;but
there’s a whole regiment of ‘if’s’ so what’s the use
of gassing? Anyway, Joy’s mine&mdash;and no man else
can get her while I live.”</p>

<p>It was the last word he said upon the subject,
and nearly three weeks later, having recovered
sufficiently to travel, he journeyed with his cousin
and the Indian up the Elkhorn. On the fourth
morning of that journey Roger Bracknell woke, to
find that preparations were already well advanced
for departure. One team was already harnessed
with a larger complement of dogs than usual, whilst
his own sled, with three dogs standing by, was still
unharnessed. His cousin indicated it with a jerk of
his head.</p>

<p>“We part company today, Roger. I’m sorry to
rob your dog team, but Joe insists as he’s afraid
you’ll get down to the police-post too soon for us,
if we leave you your full team. Besides, we’re
tackling a stiff journey and we shall need dogs
before we’re through. We’re starting immediately,
and you’ll have to breakfast alone, and by the time
you’re through with it your parole is off. You
understand?”</p>

<p>The corporal nodded, and his cousin continued,
“With only three dogs you won’t be such a fool as
to try and trail us, and we’ve left you enough grub
to get you down to North Star comfortably. Your
rifle’s there on the top of your sled, and I trust you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
not to try and use it on us till you’ve eaten your
breakfast.... So long, old man.”</p>

<p>He turned lightly away, without waiting for his
cousin to speak, and the corporal heard him humming
an old chanson of the Voyageurs&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">“Ah, ah, Babette,<br />
We go away;<br />
But we will come<br />
Again, Babette&mdash;<br />
Again back home,<br />
On&mdash;”</p>

<p class="p1">The song failed suddenly, and as Joe the Indian
cracked his whip to the waiting dogs, Dick Bracknell
looked back over his shoulder. His face was white
and twisted as if with pain, and there was anguish
in his eyes. The corporal took a hasty step towards
him, but was waved back, and the team
moved forward, the runners singing on the windswept
ice. For ten minutes the officer stood watching,
until the cavalcade passed out of sight behind a
tree-clad island, but Dick Bracknell did not look
back once. The corporal turned to the fire with a
musing look upon his face, and whilst he prepared
breakfast, his mind was with the man travelling up
the river. The interrupted chanson haunted him
and he found himself searching for the unsung fragment.
For a time it eluded him, but presently he
found it and hummed to himself&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq8 p1">“&mdash;On Easter Day&mdash;<br />
Back home to play<br />
On Easter day,<br />
Babette! Babette!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">and as he found it he understood to the full the look
of pain upon his cousin’s face. Again he looked up
the river. Beyond the island a line of black dots
appeared, and by them marched two larger dots.</p>

<p>“Poor devil!” he murmured as he turned again to
the fire.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">A DESPERATE SITUATION</p>

<p class="drop-cap15"><span class="beg">AN HOUR LATER</span> Roger Bracknell started on his
way back to the police-post, in a not very
happy frame of mind. The chief of Fort
Pilgrim was a man with little tolerance for failure,
and the corporal knew that when he made his report
it would be received with frowns. That was inevitable,
but there was nothing for it but to return.
His cousin and the Indian Joe had taken very
effective measures to prevent him following on their
trail when they had left him with a depleted dog-team
and with only sufficient rations to carry him
as far as North Star Lodge. Sorry as he was for
his cousin he yet resented the action which had left
him helpless, and his failure rankled as he swung
steadily forward on the southward trail. Before
the end of the day, however, a thought came to him.
Duty was duty, and if he could reach North Star
Lodge, there would be dogs there, and he could
requisition them in the King’s name, and return to
the pursuit. It did not seem a very nice thing to
contemplate, but his oath of service left him no
option, whilst the officer at Fort Pilgrim was bound
to look askance at the whole affair, if he returned
to explain that Koona Dick was his cousin, and that
he had escaped him. Besides, there was Joy to
consider. She could never be safe from molestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
whilst Dick Bracknell was at large. It was even
possible that the latter, finding the Territory growing
too hot for him, might venture to follow her to
England, and as her husband claim his rights. That
must be prevented at all costs, even at the cost of
Dick suffering incarceration in the penal prison at
Stony Mountain.</p>

<p>The end of the day, however, brought an unlooked-for
event, which made an end of these half-formed
plans. He had camped for the night, and
having fed his dogs with the dried salmon-roe which
formed their staple food, was preparing his own
meal, when one of the animals gave a sudden sharp
howl of pain. He looked hastily round, and saw
the dog twisted in some kind of spasm, its backbone
arched, its legs jerking in a strange fashion. He
went to it, and as he approached the spasm ended,
and the dog lay in the snow completely exhausted.
He was stooping over it, wondering what was the
matter when the other two dogs howled simultaneously,
and he turned swiftly to see one of them leap
straight in the air, and in a moment both of them
were in spasms similar to the one he had already
witnessed, and before his eyes one of them curled
up like a bow, then suddenly relaxed, and lay stark
and dead.</p>

<p>A dark suspicion shot through his mind, as he
jerked himself upright. The first dog was plainly
at the point of death, whilst the third was twisted
by spasms that could have but one ending. He
knew that there could be no recovery, that he could
do nothing for them, and in a swift impulse of mercy
he drew his pistol and shot them. Then he strode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to the sled, and lifting the small bale of dog food
carried it to the fire, and by the flames of the burning
pine examined it carefully. He had not to look
long before he came upon some small white crystals
in the creases of the roe. They might be snow,
they might be frost crystals, but he did not think
that they were either, and selecting one of the smallest
of the white specks he placed it on his tongue.
It was exceedingly bitter in taste.</p>

<p>“Strychnine!” he cried aloud, and then stood
looking at the dead dogs with horror shining in his
eyes. As he stood there one question was beating
in his brain. “Who has done this thing? Who?
Who?”</p>

<p>His thoughts flew back to his cousin. Had he&mdash;No!
He could not believe that; for whoever had
placed the strychnine in the dog food, had callously
planned to murder him. And bad as Dick Bracknell
was, the corporal felt that his cousin would not
have done a thing like this.</p>

<p>“There’s that Indian&mdash;Joe,” he said, speaking
his thoughts aloud. “From what Dick said he was
afraid of me ... and he would have disposed of
me at the beginning if he had had his way!” He
was silent for a little time, then he nodded his
head. “Yes! The Indian did it without Dick’s
knowledge.”</p>

<p>For the moment he refused to think further
about the matter. About him was the gloom of
the pines, with their pall of snow, and everywhere
the terrible silence of the North. Alone and without
dogs to carry his stores, the situation was altogether
desperate; and to reflect upon it overmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was to court madness. So he put the thought of it
from him for the time being, and after dragging
the dead dogs into the shadow of the forest, resumed
the preparation of his evening meal. When he had
eaten it, he erected a wind-screen, and lying in his
sleeping bag, with his feet to the fire, lighted a pipe,
and once more considered the problem before him.</p>

<p>It was at least four days’ journey to North Star
Lodge, probably five or six, since he would have to
carry the necessaries of life himself, and so burdened
would not be able to travel fast. There
was food for four days on the sled, and to make
sure of reaching North Star, he would have to put
himself on rations, and travel as fast as he could.
Barring accidents there was an even chance of his
getting through, but if any ill-chance arose then&mdash;He
did not finish the thought. Knocking the ashes
out of his pipe, he stretched himself down in the
sleeping berth, and presently fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was still dark, and the fire was
burning low. He looked at his watch. It was five
o’clock. He stretched himself a little, and thrusting
his arm out of the sleeping bag, he threw a
couple of spruce boughs on the fire. The resinous
wood quickly caught, and as it flared up he looked
round. On the edge of the circle of light, which
his fire cut out of the darkness, something caught
his eye. He looked again. Two tiny globes of
light, about three feet above the ground, appeared
to be suspended on nothing. He watched them
steadily, and for the briefest moment of time, saw
them eclipsed, then they reappeared. He looked
further. There were other twin globes of light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
scattered all round, and, as the spruce crackled into
flame, he caught sight of an animal’s head, and the
outline of its form.</p>

<p>“Timber-wolves!” he whispered to himself.</p>

<p>Feeling for his automatic pistol, he lay waiting
his opportunity. Undoubtedly, the bodies of his
dead dogs had already served the savage beasts
for a meal, and now they were watching him, perhaps
already counting him their prey.</p>

<p>He did not feel particularly afraid. He knew
that the wolf is really a coward, and that unless
driven by hunger, it seldom attacks man, but all the
same he thought it wise to teach the beast a lesson.
So when the shadowy form of one of the beasts
moved, he sighted and fired. The wolf gave a
yelp, jumped clean in the air, and dropped dead well
within the circle of firelight. He looked round
again. The watching eyes in the darkness had disappeared.
Presently however they returned, and
lying perfectly still, he saw a gaunt dog wolf slink
out of the shadows towards its dead comrade, and
fall on it with its teeth. Another followed and
another, and a moment later there was a snarling
tangle of furry beasts where the dead wolf had
been.</p>

<p>“Phew!” he whistled to himself, as he noted
their disregard of the firelight, “they’re mad with
hunger!”</p>

<p>He emptied his pistol into the bunch, and the
pack fell back, leaving three of its number dead
in the snow. Of the first wolf nothing remained
but the skull and tail. Behind the trees the snarling
and yelping continued, and as he crept out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sleeping bag, he conjectured that others of the
beasts had been injured by his shots, and were falling
a prey to their hungry companions. There was
a serious look upon his face, as, crossing to the
other side of the fire, he picked up the dead wolves,
and one by one flung them into the darkness, where
as his ears assured him they also became food for
their famished pack-mates.</p>

<p>He had meant to commence his journey at an
early hour, but the presence of the wolf-pack forced
him to reconsider his plans, and to delay until dawn.
The interval he filled in by packing his stores in a
convenient form for carrying, and with the aid of
things from the sled and his sleeping bag he devised
a knapsack, which whilst it bulked large was not
really heavy. Then he breakfasted, and that done,
as the dawn broke, looked round once more. On
one side of him the wolves were still in the shadows
of the trees, and as he turned to look on the other,
his eye caught the package of poisoned salmon roe,
which was still upon the sledge. A thought struck
him.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” he muttered, and going to the
sled, he broke up the food with an ax and then scattered
it in small portions about the camping place.</p>

<p>“I shall bag some of them for certain,” he said, as
he saw the wolves watching him. “When they find
it they’ll bolt it like one o’clock.”</p>

<p>The day had well broken when, adjusting his
snowshoes, he shouldered his pack, and stepped out
on the trail. None of the wolves were now in
sight, but he had gone only a little way, when a
sharp howl behind him, told him that they were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
about. He looked back. A little spur of trees on
the bank hid his late camp, but as he glanced back,
a wolf leaped on the ice, ran howling a short way,
then dropped in the snow. Other yelps of pain
came from behind the screen of trees, and as the
sounds reached him a sigh of satisfaction came in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s working like a charm,” he said to himself.
“There’s an end of Mr. Wolf for this trip, I fancy.”</p>

<p>As he journed he kept a sharp look out, turning
frequently to observe the trail behind him. Not
a single wolf appeared, and through the short day
he marched on, the solitary living thing in a landscape
that was unutterably forlorn and desolate.
The quick night drew on, and he decided to camp.
Halting in a sheltered cove he felled a small spruce,
gathered some dry twigs and built himself a fire,
then he thrust his hand to his tunic pocket for
matches. They were gone. He had lost them.
For a minute or two he was filled with dismay,
and real terror clutched at his heart-strings, for to
be without means of making a fire in the desolate
Northland, is to have entered the valley of the
shadow of death.</p>

<p>Then he recalled an old device of the Voyageurs,
and proceeded to put it into execution. With
his jack knife he cut some thin shavings of spruce,
mixed them with a handful of dead lichen scraped
from trees, and biting the bullets from a couple of
cartridges shook the powder of one over the little
heap that he had made, and with that from the other
cartridge made a short train. Then he fired his
pistol to light the train. The powder caught,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
spluttered and burned out without lighting the
lichen and the pine-shavings, and the operation had
to be performed three times before it was successful.
He built up his fire, and when it was well going, and
he was congratulating himself on his success a
thought struck him. Hastily he examined his
bandolier. He had but three cartridges left.</p>

<p>As he weighed the metal shells in his hand, his
face grew very serious. Each of them carried a
message of death, but to him, as his sole means of
making a fire, they were to him the bridge of life,
and a precarious bridge at that. With at least
three camps to make before he reached North
Star Lodge, he recognized that the chances were
almost desperate, and that only care and skill and
a large slice of luck could carry him through. Very
carefully he stowed the cartridges where they would
be safe against damp or accidental loss, and then
proceeded to cook his meal.</p>

<p>The next morning he started an hour before
dawn. Light snow was falling, but he could not
afford to regard that, and on snowshoes he pressed
forward steadily. It began to blow, and he sought
the lee of the river-bank for shelter, then that happened
which put a term to his journey. A great tree,
well up the bank, collapsed under its weight of
snow. Roger Bracknell caught the rending sound
of its fall and instinctively leaped aside, but the
snowshoes embarrassed him and he fell. A bough
of the falling tree alighted on his right leg, snapping
it like a pipestem, and pinning him down in the
snow.</p>

<p>Under the first shock of pain, he almost fainted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
but in a minute or two recovered himself sufficiently
to take stock of the situation. It was, as he instantly
recognized, very desperate. He sat up, and tried
to move the weight from his leg. The bough which
held him fast was not a very thick one, but the
weight of the tree was behind it, and with his
hatchet he began to cut through the branch. Every
stroke he made jarred him terribly, and more than
once he had to desist, but at last the bough parted,
and he was able to push the weight from his leg.
He was, however, in little better case, since he
could not stand upright; and to crawl would have
been futile, even if the deepening snow had allowed
the possibility of doing so.</p>

<p>He looked round, and through the falling snow
caught sight of the sombre pinewoods. They had
a funereal look, and in their shadows brooded the
menace of the North, which had surely overtaken
him at last. Death was staring him in the eyes.
He took out his pocket book, and made shift to
write a note to his superior down at the Post.
Then he took out his pistol, and loaded it with one
of the cartridges that had held his life, but which
now carried only death, swift and merciful. It was
no use waiting. He held the pistol ready, and for a
moment his thoughts strayed to Joy Gargrave.
Would she ever hear? Would she guess that
he&mdash;</p>

<p>His thoughts broke off suddenly. Through the
gloom of the falling snow he caught a sound of
voices. Some one, it seemed, was urging a dog-team
to greater efforts. Was he dreaming? He
listened carefully. No! There it was again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
with it came the yelp of a dog cut by a whip. A
great wave of thankfulness rolled over him. He
shouted and fired his pistol in the air. A moment
later came an answering shout, and he called back
again. Presently, out of the snow-murk emerged
the forms of two men&mdash;Indians, and as they bent
over him he lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE</p>

<p class="drop-cap07"><span class="beg">SIR JOSEPH RAYNER</span>, as a solicitor, was at
the very head of his profession, and was supposed
to be trusted with more family secrets
than any other man in England. The confidence in
him was extraordinary, but no one could be found
to urge that it was not merited, and it was notorious
that he had averted more scandals and saved more
reputations than any other half dozen men in his
profession. Erring husbands, and wives deeply
wronged, sought his advice, and to the husbands he
was a man of the world, and to the wives a sympathetic
counsellor, always against the extreme remedy
of the divorce courts. To prodigal sons he was
the dispenser of paternal allowances, and to the
men caught in the toils of the blackmailer he was
like a delivering providence. As a family solicitor
he was unsurpassed, discreet as a cabinet minister
at question time, and as secret as the grave. And
in spite of his burden of secrets, usually as he
walked abroad among men, he wore a jaunty air, as
befitted a man with not a trouble of his own in the
wide world.</p>

<p>But one winter morning as he sat in his private
office his brow was black with care, and his demeanour
was as far removed as possible from the gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
one which his confreres knew. Before him was a
small ledger with a lock upon it, and a number of
documents, and as he bent over them, from time to
time he wrote figures upon a sheet of foolscap.
Presently he began to add up the figures, and that
done sat staring at the total.</p>

<p>“Ninety-seven thousand,” he whispered to himself.
“God! If anything were to come out!”</p>

<p>He sat looking at the figures, tapping softly with
his pencil, something like despair shining in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Suppose Adrian’s fine scheme goes awry? Or
suppose Joy refuses to sign?”</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and began to walk to and
fro, in the manner of a man whom nervousness
has made restless. Once he stopped and glanced at
the ledger, then nodded his head.</p>

<p>“The others will be all right, if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The whirr of the telephone bell on his desk
interrupted his thoughts. Frowningly he picked
up the receiver, and gave the stereotyped “Hallo!”</p>

<p>“Is that really you, Adrian? I didn’t know you
had arrived.... Last night you say.... I didn’t
get your telegram. I was dining with the Chancellor,
and went on to the theatre afterwards....
Yes, you are in time, though I have been praying for
your arrival for days. Things are very tight, and
that banker is getting nervous.... Yes, the sooner
the better. In half an hour? That will do very
nicely. I shall expect you both without fail. How
goes your matrimonial scheme?... Um! Hangs
fire a little does it, but you’re certain of the end.
Well the earlier it is arranged, the better I shall be
pleased. My nerves are not what they were. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
we can talk the whole business over later. Thank
heaven, I’m her guardian, and there’s only my consent
to be obtained. What sort of a savage has she
become in these three years?”</p>

<p>As he listened to the reply to his last question a
cynical smile came on his face. “Sounds as if you
had fallen in love!... You have, hey? Well,
well (he laughed a little), love is as good a qualification
for matrimony as anything I know, except
a thundering big bank account.... Yes, yes, I
know.... I shall be waiting. That’s all, I
think.”</p>

<p>Putting down the receiver, he began to gather
up the scattered papers on his desk, and after tying
them together with tape, he placed them in a large
envelope and sealed them with his private seal.
Then he locked the books and placed both the book
and the envelope in the safe. Care appeared to
have fallen from him like a garment. He even
hummed a little catch from the halls as he took
from the safe a new set of papers. Any one looking
at him would not have known him for the care-ridden
man of ten minutes before. Once more he
was the Sir Joseph Rayner, whom the city knew,
smiling, cheerful, and exceeding prosperous.</p>

<p>“That will do, I think,” he said as he arranged
the papers on the desk. “Fortunately the girl has
no business experience.”</p>

<p>Then he went to a small cabinet in the room,
and helped himself to a glass of port of a favourite
vintage, and to while away the time smoked a couple
of cigarettes, gazing into the fire with a musing look
upon his face. At the sound of voices in the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the head clerk, he threw away his cigarette and
turned to the door. A knock sounded, and the
door opened.</p>

<p>“Miss Gargrave and Mr. Adrian, Sir Joseph.”</p>

<p>A moment later he was on his feet welcoming the
travellers.</p>

<p>“This is a pleasure, Joy. I did not know that
you had arrived until half an hour ago, not having
had the telegram which Adrian sent me. You look
wonderfully well, and Adrian looks all the better
for his vacation. Take this chair, Joy, and throw
off your furs! The cigarettes are on the mantelpiece,
Adrian, if Joy does not mind.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with a smile and Joy shook her
head.</p>

<p>“Not in the least, Uncle Joseph! Adrian knows
that!”</p>

<p>“Then we can indulge. But how are you?
You have not yet told me, though of course there
is no need. You have the authentic hue of health
in your cheeks, and goodness! what a woman you
have become! I could almost find it in my heart
to envy Adrian the long journey you have made
together!” He laughed a little as he spoke, and
glanced from Joy to his son. A slight frown showed
itself on the young man’s face, and interpreting
it rightly, Sir Joseph deftly took another line.</p>

<p>“You have not found the journey too trying,
I hope, my dear Joy? But I forget. Of course
you are inured to difficulties and hardships at North
Star, and a journey of four or five thousand miles
does not daunt you as it would a city man like
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Joy laughed a little. “There was not much
hardship once we struck the railway. A first-class
Pullman and a state-room on a Cunarder are in
themselves alleviations of the tedium of a winter
journey!”</p>

<p>Sir Joseph laughed with her. “Possibly! But
it is not every one who would find them so. I think
I could not undertake such a journey now. And I
hope there will be no need for you to do so again.
Now we have you this side of the herring pond,
I hope we may keep you here for a very long time.
Your days of exile are over, and North Star Lodge&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please, uncle,” Joy intervened quickly. “Please
do not say anything against North Star. I think
of it as my home. I was born there, you know,
and I have not found these three years to be like
years of exile&mdash;they have been full of happy days.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” laughed the lawyer, “but there are
many sorts of happiness, and after the pleasures of
the wilderness you will be the better fitted to
appreciate the delights of civilization, since all
things, as you know, gain by contrast.... But
where is Miss La Farge? I thought&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She is at the hotel. She was a little tired, but
I think that was an excuse. She knew that I was
coming here to do business&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course! Of course! Very considerate of
her I am sure; but there was no need for her to be
so punctilious. But business is really of a very
simple nature, merely the signing of a few documents
which can be completed in under half an
hour.” He waved a hand towards the desk. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
have anticipated your arrival, and everything is in
order for your signature.”</p>

<p>Joy glanced at the desk, and caught sight of the
papers. “Perhaps you will explain what the situation
is,” she said. “I am not sure that I understand.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Sir Joseph with a suave
smile. “It is not very complicated. Your father,
as you know, left a very large fortune&mdash;something
over a million pounds&mdash;in trust for you, and by his
will made me your guardian and sole trustee. One
of the conditions of the will was that for three
years you were to live at North Star Lodge, and
at the end of that time you were to be free to enter
upon your inheritance. You have fulfilled the
condition, and you now inherit. Indeed you ought
to have done so some months ago, and as my
trusteeship ended with the fulfilling of the conditions,
there are certain actions of mine that ought
to be regularized, and for which I shall require your
signature.”</p>

<p>“I do not quite follow,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“It is very simple. You were not here to administer
the estate, and though I had no authority from
you, I was compelled to do so. Of course as your
uncle and guardian there was really nothing else for
me to do.”</p>

<p>“Of course! Of course!” answered Joy hurriedly.
“And you want my signature to&mdash;to put
things right.”</p>

<p>“Just that!” answered Sir Joseph smilingly.</p>

<p>“Then the sooner you have it the better,”
laughed Joy. “Shall I sign them at once?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you like,” answered the lawyer in casual
tones, though there was a little flash of eagerness
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“It will take but a few moments.”</p>

<p>He moved towards the desk, and as Joy rose
from her seat near the fire placed a chair in position
for her. The girl seated herself, glanced carelessly
at the first document he placed before her, and then
asked, “Where do I sign?”</p>

<p>“Here!” answered the lawyer, indicating the
place. Joy signed quickly. There were other
papers that she did not even look at, but promptly
signed each one in turn, as it was presented to her.
When she had finished she laid down the pen with
a little laugh.</p>

<p>“I feel quite a woman of business.”</p>

<p>“But you are not yet out of the wood,” laughed
Sir Joseph. “There is another important matter
to be settled, and that is the future management
of the estate. It is now your own to do with as
you like. You may wish to carry through all
transactions relating to it yourself, in which case&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh no! no!” cried Joy protestingly. “I should
be worried to death. You must manage it for me
in the future as you have done in the past. I could
not possibly undertake such a task.”</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled. “I was hoping that you
would think of that course, though, for obvious
reasons I did not care to suggest it. It will be
much simpler for you merely to have monies paid
into your account instead of occupying perhaps
several hours per week in worrying over investments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>”
He laughed a little. “You would require
an office and at least a couple of clerks, Joy.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” laughed Joy, “that must never be.”</p>

<p>“Then I will take the burden off your hands, and
you will have to give me power of attorney.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” inquired Joy, adding merrily,
“I am discovering an abysmal ignorance in myself.”
Sir Joseph explained, and the girl nodded.
“Of course. There is no difficulty about that. It
only gives you the right to continue to exercise the
powers you have had up to now, and it will save me
a great deal of worry. I suppose there will be another
document to sign?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the lawyer smilingly. “One
more document to sign. Fortunately I anticipated
what your wishes would be; and I had it prepared.”
He looked at his son. “We must have a witness,
Adrian. Just ring for Benson, will you?”</p>

<p>The young lawyer touched a bell, and a moment
later a clerk entered.</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir Joseph.”</p>

<p>“In a moment, Benson. I want you to witness
Miss Gargrave’s signature.”</p>

<p>He went to the safe, took from it yet another
document which he gave to the girl.</p>

<p>“Read it, Joy.”</p>

<p>“If I must,” answered Joy, and ran through it
carelessly.</p>

<p>Then she signed it, and the clerk having witnessed
it and been dismissed, Sir Joseph gathered
all the papers together, and locked them up.
“Business is over for the day,” he said. “I’m
going to take a holiday. You will lunch with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at the Ritz, Joy, you and Adrian. I shall take no
denial.”</p>

<p>“But there is Babette&mdash;” began Joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we will telephone to her, and pick her up
on the way. We shall then be quite a complete
little party, and tonight we will dine, and go on to
a theatre afterwards. You will not have seen
much acting, of late&mdash;”</p>

<p>“None at all,” laughed Joy, “for three whole
years.”</p>

<p>“Then we must certainly go,” answered her
uncle. “Let me see&mdash;ah, yes! There is the
‘Grizzly Cub,’ a Klondyke play, pure American and
very strenuous and exciting. I have seen it once,
but I should like to see it again, with some one who
knows the country of the play. To me it seems
very real, and if it has illusions for you who know
the life, I shall know that it is really good. We
will go there. Adrian, just tell Benson to ring up
the Mitre and engage a box for me, and have my
car brought round from the garage.”</p>

<p>It was a merry party that lunched at the Ritz.
There was not a hint of the care that had betrayed
itself in the lawyer’s face in the solitude of his
private room. He was the gay, debonair man of
the world that all his acquaintances knew, and he
exerted himself to make the lunch an agreeable
one. But from time to time, he allowed his eyes
to stray towards a table where a couple of young
men were lunching with a lady. They seemed
very interested in his own party, and presently he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
saw the lady rise from her seat and walk towards
his table. At the same moment Joy Gargrave
looked up, and as she caught the young lady’s eyes,
started impulsively from her seat.</p>

<p>“You, Penelope!” she cried.</p>

<p>“You, Joy!” mimicked the other. “I thought
you were dwelling in the forest primeval?”</p>

<p>“I arrived in London last night. I expect to stay
a little time in England. The years of what my
uncle calls my exile are over.” She glanced at the
lawyer. “Do you know my uncle? No! Then
I must introduce you. Uncle, this is Miss Penelope
Winter, an old&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are wrong, Joy,” laughed the lady.
“This is no longer Miss Penelope Winter. This
is Mrs. Will Grasmore of Grasmore Grange, Westmorland.”</p>

<p>“You are married?” cried Joy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Will Grasmore waved a hand towards the
table she had just left. “There sits the happy
man, whose complete happiness began three
months ago.”</p>

<p>“Which&mdash;” began Joy, and then stopped suddenly,
as a curious look came on her face. “Of
course! I see! The other one is Geoffrey Bracknell,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed her friend, “and he is dying to
renew the acquaintance he began in Westmorland
four years ago! May I bring him and Will over?
I see that, like ourselves, you are almost at the
end of lunch. We might take coffee together.”</p>

<p>For the fraction of a minute Joy hesitated. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Joseph, who was watching her, noticed that hesitation,
though he was the only one who did. Then
Joy spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, if you like, Penelope, and if my uncle
doesn’t mind. I am his guest, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sir Joseph will not mind, I am sure,”
answered Mrs. Winter, flashing a smile at the
lawyer and assuming his consent, hurried back to
her own table.</p>

<p>“Did you say that the young man with Mr.
Winter was named Bracknell?” asked Adrian Rayner
suddenly.</p>

<p>There was just a splash of colour in Joy’s cheeks
as she replied shortly, “Yes!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he is any relation of that Mounted
policeman who came to North Star, when&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He is his cousin,” answered Joy quickly. “His
father is Sir James Bracknell of Harrow Fell.
Geoffrey is the second son.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I remember them,” broke in Sir Joseph.
“There was another son who disgraced himself and
his family. He disappeared. I wonder what has
become of him. The succession to that estate will
offer a pretty tangle for somebody to unravel some
day, Adrian.”</p>

<p>His son nodded, but uttered no comment. His
eyes were fixed on Joy, as if he found something
particularly interesting in her demeanour at the
moment. At his father’s words the splash of colour
had ebbed swiftly from her cheeks leaving them
rather pale, but Joy’s manner was perfectly self-possessed,
and there was little to indicate that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was passing through a moment of stress. Her
cousin still watched her when the others joined
them, and at the moment of meeting flashed a
quick searching glance at Geoffrey Bracknell. The
young man’s face was eager. There was a light in
his eyes that told that Mrs. Winter’s statement
about his wish to renew acquaintance with Joy had
not been over-coloured, and as he marked it, Adrian
Rayner smiled enigmatically to himself.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph also noticed it, and it troubled him a
little. He was thoughtful during the remainder of
the lunch, and even more thoughtful when, on the
evening of that same day, they again encountered
young Bracknell in the foyer of the theatre. He
was obviously waiting for them, and the lawyer was
far from pleased to learn that he had taken the
next box to his own. He was still less pleased when
the young man made an excuse for visiting them
between the acts, and it required all his skill to
avoid an acceptance of the invitation to supper
which he extended to Sir Joseph’s party.</p>

<p>“My dear Bracknell, you are too late. Our supper
is already ordered. On another occasion, perhaps,
but tonight it is quite impossible.”</p>

<p>“You did not tell me you had an admirer,” he
said to Joy, rallying her a little time later.</p>

<p>“An admirer!” Joy laughed. “Who&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Young Bracknell! He is most obviously in love
with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh no! no!” whispered Joy quickly, all the
laughter dying suddenly from her face. “You are
mistaken. It ... it would be too ... too....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The sentence went unfinished, and Sir Joseph,
noticing her face, did not press for the conclusion.
He was silent for a little time, wondering what lay
behind her sudden change of manner. Then he
spoke again.</p>

<p>“Young Bracknell is not your only admirer,” he
said smilingly. “You have another.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Joy, very obviously embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Yes! Adrian is very deeply in love. He confided
the fact to me this morning.... I hope, my
dear, that you will be able to listen to him, that you
will be able to give a favourable&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh!” interrupted Joy nervously, “you must
not ask me, uncle. I shall never marry. Never!”</p>

<p>“Never, my dear Joy! That, it is often remarked,
is a very long time!” He smiled indulgently
as he spoke, and then added, “I hope we may
yet induce you to reconsider your very youthful decision.”</p>

<p>Joy did not answer. Her face was very pale,
and she sat staring at the stage with tragic eyes,
not watching the actors, but visioning a body lying
in the snow in the sombre woods at North Star.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">A DASTARDLY DEED</p>

<p class="drop-cap05"><span class="beg">“HOW!</span>”</p>

<p class="pn">As Corporal Roger Bracknell opened his
eyes, this characteristic Indian greeting
broke on his ears, and he stirred uneasily. Slowly
the full consciousness of things came back to him,
and with it the sense of intolerable pain in one of
his legs. He raised his head to look at the leg
and stretched a hand towards it at the same time.
Another hand intervened hastily.</p>

<p>“No. Not dat! You damage ze leg, if you
touch. It vaire bad!”</p>

<p>The corporal turned his eyes. The two men
were standing near the bale of skins on which he was
lying, one of them of pure Indian blood, and the
second, who had uttered the warning, manifestly
a half-breed. Behind them in the darkness of the
tepee was a third man, also an Indian. He addressed
himself to the half-breed.</p>

<p>“How did I come here?”</p>

<p>“Lagoun and Canim dey find you on ze trail. A
tree hav’ fallen an’ crack your leg like a shell of
the egg. You not able to move, so dat eef dey not
come soon, you dead mans along of ze cold which
freeze ze blood. Dey bring you here an’ I set ze
leg, so dat it grow together again. Dat is all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Coporal Bracknell looked towards the two Indians.
“I am very grateful to you, Lagoun and
Canim, and I shall not forget,” he said. “I shall
report good of them at the Post. But where am
I?”</p>

<p>“At ze winter encampment of my people!” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“Of your people. Who are you then?”</p>

<p>“I am Chief Louis of ze Elkhorn tribe. You
hear of me, maybe?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the corporal quickly. “Who is
there that has not?”</p>

<p>He looked with interest on the man, who was
the son of a French-Canadian and an Indian
mother, and who throwing in his lot with his
mother’s people had risen to the headship of the
tribe. And whilst he looked at him the Chief
spoke again.</p>

<p>“It ees not good to walk alone in ze North without
dogs an’ sled as Lagoun and Canim find you.”</p>

<p>“It is very bad,” laughed the policeman weakly.
“But part of my dogs were stolen from me, and
the others died.”</p>

<p>“Dat is vaire bad,” was the reply. “Lagoun and
Canim dey find ze sled, and dead wolves&mdash;many of
dem. Dey haf been poisoned. How befell it, so?”</p>

<p>The corporal explained, carefully avoiding any
reference to his cousin and the latter’s Indian companion,
and when he had finished, the Chief nodded
approbation.</p>

<p>“Dat was clevaire to poison ze wolves, for dey
hav’ ze hunger-madness at dis time, ze mooze being
scarce in ze woods.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>For a little time Bracknell did not speak, then
he glanced down towards his leg, and asked, “Is
it very bad?”</p>

<p>“It veel knit together like ze ice on ze river!”
was the reply. “An’ you veel not be lame mans.
No! But two months veel pass before you take
ze trail again.”</p>

<p>“Two months. The ice will be breaking up by
then.”</p>

<p>“Oui! dat so! But what matter? Time it ees
long in ze North, an’ we can talk together. Where
did the trail lead for you, m’sieu?”</p>

<p>“I was making for North Star Lodge in the first
instance. There, I hoped to get dogs to take me
to the police post.”</p>

<p>Chief Louis did not speak for a little time. He
lit an Indian pipe made of some soft stone with a
hollowed twig for stem, pulled thoughtfully at it
a few times, blowing out clouds of acrid smoke,
then he said slowly, “You were going to North
Star? You ever know Missi Gargrave’s father?”</p>

<p>“No!” answered the policeman. “He was dead
before I came so far North. I understand that he
was caught in the ice in the Yukon&mdash;and lost. The
bottom dropped out of the trail or something.”</p>

<p>“Him die, oui,” was the brief reply.</p>

<p>Something in the other’s tone caught the policeman’s
attention. He looked at him quickly. The
half-breed’s face was like that of a wooden image,
but there was a glitter in the eyes that betrayed an
excitement which the mask-like visage concealed.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he commented. “You know how Rolf
Gargrave died!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“I not say so! But I tink an’ tink, an’ I tink
it was not good ze way Gargrave die. Non!”</p>

<p>Bracknell waited, but the half-breed did not continue,
and after a little time he said quietly, “Tell
me.”</p>

<p>“Not now. It is ze hour of ze evening meal;
an’ ze tale will keep. I tell you anoder time.”</p>

<p>He knocked the ashes from his pipe, nodded
gravely at the officer and passed out of the tepee,
leaving Bracknell the prey of a great curiosity.
What on earth was the tale which the half-breed
had to tell about Rolf Gargrave’s death? He
recalled the little that he had heard about the disappearance
of the Northland millionaire and could
remember nothing which indicated that his death
had been due to anything but an accident. As he
remembered the story the river-ice on which Mr.
Gargrave and his party of four Indians had been
travelling had suddenly turned rotten, in Northland
phrase, “the bottom had dropped out of the
trail,” and the whole party had been drowned,
with a single exception. The exception was one of
the Indians who had managed to crawl out, and
later in the day reached an Indian lodge there,
after telling the story of the disaster, to die of
cold and exhaustion. Mr. Gargrave’s death had
been a tragedy, but such tragedies were not uncommon
in the North; and the police, hearing of the
event months afterward, had seen no reason for
investigation. Every spring brought similar stories
with it; and would, so long as men persisted in
keeping to the ice-trails when once the spring thaw
had set in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>But Chief Louis’s vague hints had perplexed
Roger Bracknell, and awakened formless suspicions
in his mind. Suppose that the death of Joy’s father
had not been an accident, suppose&mdash;</p>

<p>He broke off his conjectures. It was no use indulging
in idle speculations when a short time would
probably dispose of any need for them. He gave
his mind to the consideration of his own position.
As he recognized, his escape from death had been
a very narrow one, and though he would have to
remain where he was, probably for many weeks, he
counted himself fortunate. Chief Louis held the
Mounted Police in esteem, and would look after
him well, and though the delay would probably
mean that his Cousin Dick would escape, he could
not find it in his heart to regret that over much.
The Indian, Joe, was another matter. He was
convinced that by poisoning his dog-food the Indian
had deliberately planned his death, and as he
thought of the means employed, a hot wrath burned
within him. It was so cruel, so treacherous, and he
vowed to himself that one day he would make the
Indian pay for it.</p>

<p>His thoughts wandered further to Joy Gargrave!
She would be in England or well on her way there,
and wondering how his quest had sped. He was
now in a position to fulfil his promise to her, but
he doubted whether such news as he had to send
her would be any comfort to her, for the news
that Dick Bracknell was alive, and making for the
fastnesses of the Northern wilderness, could hardly
be good news for her, who had been so bitterly
deceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the next day when Chief Louis unfolded
the mystery of Rolf Gargrave’s death. Seating
himself by the corporal’s side, he puffed slowly at
his pipe for some time, and the officer watched him,
wondering what was in his mind and when he would
speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly the half-breed leaned forward and said
abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ze bottom nevaire drop out of ze trail under
Rolf Gargrave!”</p>

<p>“No?” The corporal’s voice was eager and his
manner alert.</p>

<p>“It was blown out!”</p>

<p>“Blown out! What on earth do you mean,
Louis?”</p>

<p>“Listen and I veel the tale unfold. Tree winters
back, no four! dere come to my tepee a white man
who was not used to ze ways of ze North. With
him vas another mans who had ze coughing-sickness,
and who need the squaws to nurse him. He
die vaire shortly&mdash;six days after he come, an’ we
give him tree-burial; and ze next day, ze other
white mans he come to me. He want two men to
go on trail with him to ze North, an’ he pay with
blankets, two rifles of ze best, mooch cartridges,
and many sticks of tabac. He vaire anxious, and
I ask him what for he go North before ze spring
it have arrive. And he say he go to find a mans.
What mans? I ask, and he say Rolf Gargrave,
whom he would talk with on business of importance.
Den I understand, I tink, Gargrave he is a man of
many affairs, an’ this man who know not ze ways
of ze North hav’ come so far to talk of gold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
ze like, and I agree, and send two men of ze tribe
with him to find Gargrave of North Star.</p>

<p>“Dey be good men, who know ze ways of ze
trail as none other, but dey are gone a vaire long
time, an’ ze wild geeze hav’ gone to their breeding
grounds in ze far North, an’ ze river it is free from
ice, when dey return. I question dem, and it is
a strange tale dey tell. For many days dey travel
with ze stranger mans whose name I know not,
an’ dey are on the trail of Gargrave all ze time.
Dey hear word of him, now here, now dere, and
it is a long trail dey follow, but at ze last dey
come up with him. Dey hav’ word dat he is but
one camp ahead of dem, an’ dey push the dogs,
an’ soon dey pass Gargrave’s camp.”</p>

<p>“Pass it?” cried the corporal in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Oui! Dey pass a camp which is Gargrave’s
an’ with ze darkness falling, dey push on five, six
mile, an’ dere pitch camp, an’ ze stranger mans
say he wait for Gargrave dere. It begins to snow,
an’ dere is wind, an’ dey crouch by ze fire, an’
sleep, one hour, two hours, tree&mdash;I know not. Den
Paslik an’ Sibou dey wake suddenly, an’ dere is the
roll of thunder in their ears. Dey listen in wonder
and again dey hear it, a crash like dat among ze
hills when the sun scorches ze grass an’ ze earth
it shake an’ tremble.</p>

<p>“Dey look about. Ze white-man’s sleeping bag
it is empty, and he is not dere. Dey wait a long
time. Ze thunder sound no more, but ze snow
still fall, an’ presently, ze stranger mans he return.
He hav’ on ze snowshoes an’ he hav’ been on a
journey. He tell Paslik an’ Sibou dat he not sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
dat he hav’ been for little walk to help him. But
he is vaire tired, an’ dere is a strange look on his
face, and Paslik he whisper to Sibou dat the
stranger man hav’ been a long journey.... Den
ze snow still falling, dey all sleep till dawn....</p>

<p>“All next day, in ze camp dere, dey wait for
ze coming of Gargrave, but he come not, and Paslik
he see dat after a time ze mans look not towards
ze river-trail, an’ dat dare is a pleased look on his
face, a look as of one who has his desire given
unto him. Ze next morning, they strike camp,
an’ ze stranger mans he say dey go back and look
for Gargrave. To Paslik an’ Sibou, ze way of the
white man is foolishness, but dey go back, an’ tree
miles down ze trail dey find the ice hav’ been broken
in. It hav’ frozen over again, but ze snow about
have melt an’ frozen in with ze ice, an’ it is rotten.
Also dere are great chunks of ice thrown far out
over ze snow, which is a strange thing.... Dey
cross the broken trail with care, an’ at the far side,
dey come on ze tracks of two sleds that hav’ moved
in ze direction of ze rotten ice.</p>

<p>“Ze stranger mans he look at dese an’ den he
looks back at ze broken trail, an’ den he whistle
cheerfully all to himself. Paslik he look, an’ he
read ze signs, an’ he whisper dat ze sleds hav’ gone
in, ze sleds an’ ze mans, an’ den dey go forward
till dey reach ze camp of Gargrave dat dey pass
on ze way. He is not dere, ze camp is remove,
an’ ze ashes of ze fire are cold. Ze white mans
he look, an’ he laugh, but it was ze laugh of a
man who is not disappointed, you understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘We hav’ missed him,’ he say. ‘We return to
Dawson.’</p>

<p>“So Paslik an’ Sibou, dey go to Dawson with
him, an’ dere dey hear that Gargrave is lost, because
of ze bottom dropping from ze trail an’ casting
him in ze river. One mans he have crawled
out, he tell ze tale an’ die. An’ Paslik an’ Sibou
say nothing, an’ ze stranger mans he give them his
dogs an’ sled an’ stores and leave Dawson, and
presently when ze river is open dey come back, and
whisper to me the tale of their wanderings, and
I say ze trail it not fall in, but it is blown out.”</p>

<p>The half-breed broke off, and lighting his pipe,
puffed at it stolidly, staring into the fire. For a
full half-minute the corporal did not speak. The
implications of the other’s story were very clear
to him, but they seemed incredible.</p>

<p>“But what makes you so sure?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>Chief Louis rose from his seat and without speaking
passed from the tepee. After a few minutes
he returned bringing with him a wooden box with a
hinged lid. He opened it, and held it towards the
corporal, who looked in curiously. Inside half-wrapped
in cotton wool were four cakes of some
reddish brown material, and when the corporal’s
eyes fell on them, he gave vent to a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“You know what dat is? You hav’ before it
seen?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” answered Bracknell quickly. “It is dynamite.
How did you come by it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ze stranger mans he leaves it in ze stores dat
he give Paslik an’ Sibou. He forget it, or he tink
dey get meddling with it an’ blow themselves to
Hell. But dey bring it back, and I know it, and
I keep it; and remembering ze winter thunder which
Paslik an’ Sibou dey hear in their sleep, I say ze
trail it was blown up, an’ not fall in, behold, Paslik
an’ Sibou wi’ ze stranger mans go all ze way to
Dawson, an’ ze trail it is good.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Louis, I believe you are right.”</p>

<p>“Dere is no question. It is so sure as ze rising
of ze sun!”</p>

<p>A dark thought shot in the corporal’s mind.
Four winters ago this had happened, and in that
year Dick Bracknell, who had trapped Joy Gargrave
into marriage, had fled from England. Rolf
Gargrave’s death might be conceived to serve the interests
of his son-in-law, and Rolf Gargrave had
been murdered.</p>

<p>“Louis,” he asked abruptly, “what sort of a man
was he whom Paslik and Sibou served?”</p>

<p>“He was tall, with full beard and dark eyes.
His voice was of ze English an’ not of ze American,
for he talked not through the nose.”</p>

<p>The description was not very illuminating, and
the policeman almost groaned.</p>

<p>“His hair? did you mark the colour?”</p>

<p>“It was like ze bear&mdash;what you call brown, ze
brown of ze wood-nuts in autumn!”</p>

<p>Brown! Dick Bracknell’s was brown, but then
so was the hair of half the Anglo-Saxon race!</p>

<p>As his mind clutched at this fact seeking escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
from the awful thought which was taking possession
of it, he frowned.</p>

<p>“You know ze mans?” asked the half-breed.</p>

<p>“No!” he cried violently. “No!”</p>

<p>“All ze same,” said Chief Louis stolidly, “that
mans he blow up ze trail.”</p>

<p>And from that conclusion, at any rate, Roger
Bracknell could find no escape.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">TWO PROPOSALS</p>

<p class="drop-cap05"><span class="beg">THREE</span> days after her visit to the theatre
with Sir Joseph Rayner, Joy Gargrave
went north to Westmorland, accompanied
by Miss La Farge. She was staying with old
friends a few miles from the home of Sir James
Bracknell at Harrow Fell, and her hostess, remembering
Dick Bracknell’s devotion to her, gossiped
freely.</p>

<p>“You remember Sir James’ eldest son, the one
whom we used to say ran on your heels, Joy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Joy, in a voice that was not very
encouraging.</p>

<p>“He went to the dogs&mdash;all the way. There was
a bad scandal, and though it was hushed up for Sir
James’ sake, Dick Bracknell had to run the country.
No one knows where he is now or whether he is
alive or dead, but it is thought the latter; anyway,
we are all beginning to look on Geoffrey as the heir
of Harrow Fell. He is coming over here at the
week-end for the final grouse-shoot of the season,
and Adrian Rayner is coming also. Your uncle
fished for an invitation for him, and my husband
could not very well refuse, you know. I fancy,”
she added with a knowing little laugh, “it isn’t
merely grouse he is after.”</p>

<p>Joy gave no sign of understanding, but when the
week-end arrived, bringing with it Adrian Rayner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
she was left in no uncertainty as to her cousin’s intentions.
He haunted her steps. He was always
at hand with assistance which she did not want; and
when Geoffrey Bracknell also arrived, there was
something like open rivalry between them. Her
friend and hostess laughed.</p>

<p>“You will have a brace of proposals before the
shoot is over, Joy.”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it,” answered Joy quickly.</p>

<p>“You will not be able to help it,” was the reply.
“They are both determined young men and their
minds are made up.”</p>

<p>“So is mine,” replied Joy.</p>

<p>Yet it was as her hostess said. On the day of the
shoot, Geoffrey Bracknell walked with her across
the moor towards the “butts” built of turf and behind
which they were to wait for the driven birds.
They reached her own shelter first, and as she
dropped to an improvised seat, Geoffrey Bracknell
halted and looked down at her.</p>

<p>“Miss Gargrave, there is&mdash;er&mdash;something that
I want to say, and to&mdash;a&mdash;ask you.”</p>

<p>She looked up and met his honest eyes, eyes that
to her mind recalled not his brother, her husband,
but the eyes of his cousin Corporal Bracknell of the
Mounted Police. What she read there brought
a quick flush to her face, and she hastily put up a
protesting hand.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Bracknell, don’t! Don’t spoil our
friendship!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the young man, his face paling a
little, “you understand what I want. Is it really
quite impossible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered with directness, “it is quite
impossible.”</p>

<p>Geoffrey Bracknell whistled softly to himself.
He had suffered a blow, but he strove to behave
like a gentleman. “Then I am sorry to have
troubled you, Miss Gargrave. Of course I knew
that I was not&mdash;er&mdash;worthy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is not that,” she intervened in a distressed
voice. “It is&mdash;something else, it has nothing to do
with you at all!”</p>

<p>“But it knocks me out!” he said trying to smile.
“Well, it is the fortune of war. I suppose that I
shall have to persuade the governor to let me go
on a big game trip, now. That is, the proper thing
to do under the circumstances, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Again she met his eyes, he was still smiling, but
she could see the effort it required. She held out
a hand impulsively.</p>

<p>“Geoffrey,” she said, “don’t let this spoil your
life, or our friendship. I cannot now explain what
makes my refusal imperative. Some day I may be
able to, and when I can I shall tell you, if you are
still my friend.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to tell me,” he said frankly,
“for I shall always be that. Couldn’t be anything
else, you know.... But there’s the head-keeper
signalling; I must move on to my own butt. Good
hunting!”</p>

<p>He laughed with forced lightness and walked
away. Joy watched him go with pain at her heart.
How like his cousin he was, and how unlike his
brother! She felt very sorry for the boy, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
incident had disturbed her so much that she shot
very badly. Again and again as the birds came
driving towards her she either didn’t fire or fired
too late, but from the butt where Geoffrey Bracknell
waited, the shots came at regular intervals, and
she saw the birds drop every time. Then a covey
of grouse came driving with the wind straight
towards her neighbour’s shelter. She waited.
There was a sharp report, and a sudden cry, and
the birds drove on. She looked towards the shelter.
It was almost in a line with her own, and she could
see something lying on the ground behind it.
Another flock of birds drove down the wind, but
there was no shot from Geoffrey Bracknell’s gun.
A sudden fear assailed her. Leaving her own gun
resting against the turf wall, she ran towards the
next butt. Before she reached it, she knew that
something dreadful had happened, for she could
see that the young man was lying on his back in the
heather. She reached the shelter and a cry broke
from her.</p>

<p>White faced and still, with a ghastly wound in
his right temple, Geoffrey Bracknell lay there, quite
dead. As she looked at him, she had no doubt
whatever about the matter, and a great agony
surged up in her heart.</p>

<p>Had he&mdash;? Her eyes fell on the gun close
by, and before the thought which had assailed her
was completed she knew that it was groundless.
The lock of the gun was blown out, and the base
of both barrels was fractured. It had been an
accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank God,” she whispered to herself, delivered
from the fear which had assailed her, “it was not&mdash;”</p>

<p>She dropped on her knees by his side and took
his hand. It was already cold, as she raised it to
her lips.</p>

<p>“Poor boy! Poor boy!”</p>

<p>She was in tears as she rose from her knees,
and began to walk towards the next butt. The
news spread quickly and the shoot was stopped,
and the body was taken first to the village, and
later in the day to Harrow Fell. And that night
Joy’s hostess, discussing the tragedy, set a problem
before her, which kept her awake far into the night.</p>

<p>“Poor Sir James,” she said. “He is left without
a child, for as I told you no one knows anything
at all about Dick Bracknell, and it doesn’t matter
very much whether he is alive or dead, to any one
but his cousin Roger, for he can never return to
England.”</p>

<p>“To his cousin Roger,” echoed Joy, visioning
the corporal, “why should it matter to him?”</p>

<p>“Because if Dick is out of the way, Harrow Fell
will pass to him on Sir James’ death. The estates
are entailed, you know.”</p>

<p>Instantly Joy saw the difficulties of the situation.
Dick Bracknell might be dead, or he might be
very much alive. In the former case, the way was
quite clear for his cousin; but in the latter, there
were possibilities that filled her with dread. The
corporal had left North Star in an endeavour to
solve the mystery of the disappearance of his
cousin’s body. If Dick Bracknell were yet alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and he overtook him, he would probably try to effect
his arrest, and if Dick resisted there might be trouble,
and possibly Corporal Bracknell might be
driven to have recourse to arms. Suppose he shot
his cousin, and so, in innocence, cleared his own way
to the succession of Harrow Fell? Her face
clouded, and an anxious look came into her eyes.
She was recalled to herself by her hostess’s voice.</p>

<p>“A penny for your thoughts, Joy.”</p>

<p>Joy prevaricated a little. “I was thinking what
a strange coil life is!” she answered.</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“Well, the last person I spoke to, before I left
North Star to come to England, was Roger Bracknell!”</p>

<p>“Roger Bracknell!” echoed her hostess in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is in the Mounted Police, and, in the
way of duty, he came to North Star, three days or
so before I left.”</p>

<p>“That is an odd coincidence,” was the comment.
“What did you think of him, my dear?”</p>

<p>Joy answered with reserve. “He seemed to be
very nice&mdash;a gentleman, you know.”</p>

<p>Her hostess smiled. “Yes, Roger is that&mdash;the
right sort, as my husband would say. He, at any
rate, will never disgrace the Bracknell clan, for he
is at the opposite pole from his cousin Dick.
What did he look like?”</p>

<p>“Like a mounter!” answered Joy quickly.</p>

<p>“A mounter! Don’t talk slang, Joy. Interpret,
please.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Joy smilingly, “a mounter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
a member of the Royal North West Mounted
Police, who are as fine a body of men as you may
find from one end of the Empire to the other.”</p>

<p>“And therefore Roger Bracknell is a fine man,
hey?”</p>

<p>“He struck me as being so!” answered Joy composedly.
Her friend glanced at her with shrewd
eyes. “Hum!” she said. “You are very discreet,
my dear Joy. Now you know that the truth is
that Roger Bracknell is a man who takes the eye, a
handsome man in fact, and why you should be
reluctant to own up&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Own up! What do you mean?” interrupted
Joy, her face growing suddenly scarlet.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” laughed her friend, “except that
Roger Bracknell is a man to whom few women
could be as indifferent as you pretend to be. But
I must cut this conversation short. There’s
Adrian Rayner looking for you, and coming this
way. I’ll send him on to you.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t,” cried Joy; but her hostess only
laughed, and as she walked towards the young man
Joy fled to her room.</p>

<p>Late into the night she considered the possibilities
which had presented themselves to her mind at
the mention of Roger Bracknell’s possible succession
to Harrow Fell, and in the morning she rode
to the post office in the neighbouring country town,
and there dispatched two cablegrams, one to
Roger Bracknell, care of the Police Commissioner
at Regina, explaining to him the circumstances, and
one to the Commissioner himself asking for the
whereabouts of Corporal Bracknell, prepaying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
reply. Three days later the reply reached her in
London.</p>

<p>“Corporal Bracknell reported as missing. Supposed
lost.”</p>

<p>When she received it, she was greatly distressed,
and rather hurriedly made up her mind to
return at once to North Star. Why she should do
so, she did not make clear even to herself; and when
Adrian Rayner pressed her for her reason, she was
covered with confusion.</p>

<p>“Joy,” he protested, “you must not do anything
so foolish. You have fulfilled the terms of your
father’s will to the letter, and now your place is
here in England. We all want you here! I want
you more than any one else on earth. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>She gave him no reply to the question, but he
explained further, leaving her no room for doubt.
“I love you, Joy. I loved you when you were here
in England three years ago. I loved you at North
Star. I love you more madly than ever, now.
Will you marry me?”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” she said. “Don’t press me, Adrian.”</p>

<p>“But why can’t you?” he asked ruthlessly. “At
least you owe me a reason for refusal. I wonder
if that reason has anything to do with this foolishness
of returning to North Star.”</p>

<p>She was a little startled by the acuteness of his
conjecture, and did not immediately reply. He
smiled a trifle grimly, and then continued. “If it
has, you can dismiss that reason from your mind
for good. Dick Bracknell is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dick Bracknell! What&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Her voice faltered as she met his gaze. “Yes,”
he answered. “Dick Bracknell, <i>alias</i> Koona Dick.
He was your husband, wasn’t he? You married
him down at Alcombe, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” she asked quiveringly.</p>

<p>“That is a private matter,” he replied. “Just
as your marriage was private; and just as the manner
of your husband’s death must be kept private
for the good of us all.”</p>

<p>“What ... what do you mean, Adrian?” she
asked in a trembling voice, her face ghastly with
sudden terror.</p>

<p>“I mean that I know who shot Koona Dick,” he
answered slowly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped, her hand over her heart in
a wild endeavour to stay its fierce beating. “Oh!
what&mdash;what&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There is no need for you to be other than frank
with me. I saw the whole thing. I saw you get
that message. I followed you into the woods.
You took a gun with you, and you hid in the trees
where you could see your husband arrive. I saw
the flame of your shot, and that same second Dick
Bracknell fell in the snow. Mark you, I do not
blame you. Dick Bracknell was worthless and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But oh!” sobbed Joy with horror in her face.
“You are mistaken. It is not true. I never&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why try to bluff me, Joy? I say I saw you
and if you were not the person who killed Dick
Bracknell, why did you make no mention of what
had occurred when you returned to the Lodge?
That is not the way of innocence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Joy did not reply. Her face was buried in her
hands and she was sobbing convulsively. Rayner
looked at her with shrewd eyes, then after a moment
resumed in an altered tone&mdash;</p>

<p>“As I have said, Joy, my dear, I do not blame
you; I even went out of my way to help you that
night.”</p>

<p>“You ... you went&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly, I saw that policeman find Dick’s body,
and afterwards leave it, and go towards the
Lodge. I knew that things might be awkward if the
truth came out, so I disposed of the body.”</p>

<p>“You disposed of the body?” She lifted her
head suddenly, and through her tears looked at
him incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered airily. “It is difficult to
prove a crime if there is no evidence of it, so I
removed the material evidence, to the utter confusion
of any theory that Corporal Bracknell might
have formed.”</p>

<p>“But how? What&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I carried it away, and dropped it through an
ice-hole in the river. It will never be found until
the ice breaks up in the spring, and then it is not
at all likely. I took a little risk, I know; but I
did it for your sake, believe me, Joy, quite as much
as for my own.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand how it affected you,”
faltered the girl.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” answered Rayner suavely.
“But you have heard the reason. I loved you. I
wanted to marry you, even at that time I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
you; for I recognized that you were distraught
when you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh please! Please! Do not say it!” she
cried.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he answered. “I will not. But
you understand the position, and I think you will
agree that knowing what I know there are not a
great number of men who would wish to marry
you.”</p>

<p>“And why should you?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Again because I love you.”</p>

<p>She sat there in silence, staring absently at a vase
of chrysanthemums on the table, and seeing them
not at all. In her mind she was again living
through the horror of that night at North Star,
searching for something that would give the lie to
Adrian Rayner’s statement. And suddenly she remembered
something. That sled which had
halted in the wood. Who had been with it? Her
gaze moved quickly from the vase to her cousin’s
face, and on it she surprised a cynical, calculating
look that stirred deep distrust in her.</p>

<p>“You say you dropped Dick Bracknell’s body
through the ice? It was rather a long way to the
river. How did you get it there?”</p>

<p>For one second Rayner hesitated. He was not
sure of the bearing of the question, but after the
brief hesitation he answered, “I carried it, of
course.”</p>

<p>Joy had marked the hesitation, and to her came
the swift realization that he was lying. She
marked his slim form, and remembered Dick Bracknell’s
height and bulk, and the sudden conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
deepened. But she gave no hint of it to Rayner,
who stood watching her, sure that he could bend her
to his will. She offered no comment on his reply,
but thoughtfully twisted a ring upon her finger,
while her mind sought for a way out of her immediate
difficulty.</p>

<p>“Well, Joy,” he asked, “you will marry me?”</p>

<p>She rose abruptly from her chair. “No,” she
said on a sudden impulse. “Not on the evidence of
Dick’s death that you offer. I cannot consider&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are not wise!” he interrupted. “You are
in my hands, remember.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you mistake me,” she cried. “I am
not saying that I will never marry you. I am
only saying that the evidence of Dick’s death is
not sufficiently convincing.” She lifted a hand as
he would have interrupted her. “No! Let me
finish. When we left Corporal Bracknell at North
Star, he knew that I was Dick’s wife, and he undertook
to find out what had become of Dick’s body.
There was some one else in the woods at North
Star that night, some one who probably witnessed
all that occurred. That person, I fancy, Roger
Bracknell means to find. And when I have heard
that man’s story&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You shall certainly hear it, for I will find that
man myself. I will drag him across the world to
tell it to you.”</p>

<p>He spoke vehemently, passionately, but in his
bearing there was something besides vehemence and
passion. His face had gone white, and in his eyes
was a furtive look. Joy noticed these signs, but
gave no indication of having done so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“You!” she cried, “you will go? What will you
be able to do?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered sharply. “I will go. I will
do what your bungling corporal has not been able
to do. I will bring you proof of Dick Bracknell’s
death. I will find that man who was in the wood,
if there was a man&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There is no question of that,” she broke in. “I
found his trail, and Corporal Bracknell found it
too. I believe he followed it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>The expression on Rayner’s face, as the interjection
broke from him, was one of mingled chagrin
and fear. Joy noticed it, and it set her wondering
again. Then quite suddenly she remembered something.
Roger Bracknell had asked her if Adrian
Rayner knew of her marriage with her cousin.
She had answered that he did not, but he had known
all the time! The significance of the question had
not made itself felt at the time, but now it broke
on her with startling force, and Rayner saw that
something had happened to which he had no clue.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>“Nothing!” she answered evasively. “But in
view of all the circumstances I think I shall return
to North Star myself before long.”</p>

<p>He was about to reply when there came an interruption.
Miss La Farge entered the room.</p>

<p>“The car is waiting, Joy, and we are behind time.
We really must be going if Mr. Rayner can excuse
you.”</p>

<p>“Right, Babette. Cousin Adrian was just about
to go, as we have finished our discussion, I believe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Rayner nodded. “Yes,” he said. “We have
finished, and I am going. But I shall see you again,
Joy, very shortly, certainly before I go to the
North.”</p>

<p>Joy nodded and making his adieu Adrian Rayner
passed out of the room.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">MISSING</p>

<p class="drop-cap03"><span class="beg">“MR. RAYNER</span> is going to the North?”
questioned Miss La Farge.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is going to Canada&mdash;and so am
I, as early as possible. You will not mind accompanying
me, Babette.”</p>

<p>“Mind! I shall be more than glad to get back
to the silent North. This noisy London gets on
my nerves, and the smell of the streets is horrible.
It is petrol everywhere. The place reeks of it,
and after the aromatic spruce woods the air here
is like poison. I shall rejoice to go, and to hear
the bell of the moose again in place of hideous
motor horns.”</p>

<p>She looked at Joy, as she spoke, and there was
a question in her eyes. Joy nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will tell you why we go. My cousin
Adrian has just asked me to marry him&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Indeed! But I am not surprised. The signs
of the weather have been unmistakable for a little
time. And of course he does not know of Dick
Bracknell!”</p>

<p>“But he does! He has known all the time. He
even stooped to use his knowledge so as to bring
pressure upon me.”</p>

<p>“How shameful!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes! But that is of small moment. Don’t you
see the significance of the fact that he had knowledge
of my marriage? He was aware of it all the
time, and as you know he made love to me. Even
at North Star&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! But you do not think that he fired
the shot which&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do not know what to think! I am going to
find out. Of one thing I am sure, and that is that
cousin Adrian is afraid of what Corporal Bracknell
may discover. And Corporal Bracknell has disappeared.
He may have learned much that I want to
know, and something may have befallen him. He
may even be dead, but if he is alive we must find him
before Cousin Adrian does. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I do! You have grown afraid of
what Mr. Rayner may do.”</p>

<p>“I do not trust him. I cannot after&mdash;” She
broke off. “I am my own mistress now. There is
no need that I should consult any one as to my comings
and goings. We will go down to the steamship
offices at once. We will not waste even a moment.”</p>

<p>An hour later they entered the office of a famous
shipping company in Cockspur Street, and there inquired
for a boat sailing for the Dominion.</p>

<p>“There is the <i>Argonaut</i>. She sails from Liverpool
in three days. I believe there are vacancies.”
The clerk turned away and presently came back with
a list in his hand.</p>

<p>“The accommodation is limited, I find. There
are only a couple of cabins-de-luxe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We will take them!” said Joy promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you! What names, Miss?”</p>

<p>The names were given, and within ten minutes the
transaction was completed, and Joy left the office
with the tickets in her handbag. Just as her car
started a taxi approached from the opposite direction,
almost collided with it, and it was only by a
decidedly dangerous swerve that an accident was
averted. The taxi-driver glanced round at his passenger
as if expecting a rebuke, but to his relief the
man was leaning far back in the corner as if anxious
to avoid observation. The vehicle drew up at the
shipping offices, and the passenger left the taxi and
entered the offices. He was Adrian Rayner.</p>

<p>The clerk who had completed Joy’s business
attended to him and listened to his request.</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir! The last two cabins on the <i>Argonaut</i>
have just been taken. There isn’t a vacant
berth in the ship.”</p>

<p>Rayner considered. He had not the slightest
doubt that Joy Gargrave and her foster-sister had
taken those cabins, for he had seen them leaving the
offices. A dark frown came on his face, which the
clerk misinterpreted for disappointment. An idea
occurred to him.</p>

<p>“You are in a hurry, sir?” he inquired</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Rayner shortly.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, if I may venture to suggest it to you,
the <i>Maple Leaf</i> sails at six o’clock from Southampton.
She is not a full boat, and if there is a train
you might yet catch her.”</p>

<p>“Look at the time table, quick!” was the reply.
The clerk obeyed. “There is a train in three quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of an hour, sir. It is a slow train, but it is
due in Southampton five and twenty minutes before
sailing time. You should be able to do it easily,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll book a cabin, please. As quick as you
can. I’ve some luggage to pack.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later he left the office, and raced to
his chambers, where he kept the taxi waiting whilst
he packed a small portmanteau. Then he rang up
Sir Joseph Rayner at the office. It was the head
clerk’s voice that replied.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Adrian, Sir Joseph is out. He will
not return today. Any message, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Let him know somehow that I’m going
to America this evening. Tell him I will write,
and&mdash;er&mdash;Benson&mdash;remember that this piece of
news is strictly private.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Adrian.”</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver, lit a cigar, and five minutes
after was on his way to Waterloo.</p>

<p class="pc ls3">.......</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Joy, when we land?”
As she asked the question, Miss La Farge turned
from contemplating the greyness of the winter seascape
and looked at her foster-sister.</p>

<p>“I am going straight through to Regina to find out
if anything has been heard of Roger Bracknell. If
they have no news of him at the barracks, then we
will go North and ourselves try and learn what has
befallen him. He may have news for me, as I certainly
have news for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you mean that we shall set out to search for
him?”</p>

<p>“Just that, Babette. We know that he was
going up the river, and I have a fancy he was following
a trail which I myself noticed. You and I
know the country well, and with the Indian George,
we could look for him. At least we may learn
something about him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Babette thoughtfully. “And if
we find him, as you say, he may have news. You
may learn what really happened to your hus&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please! Please, Babette. Don’t call Dick
Bracknell that. I can’t bear to think that I am
bound to him at all.”</p>

<p>“No, and if he is dead, you are released! What
do you really think, Joy?”</p>

<p>“I am in doubt. I have always been in doubt
since that night. It was so strange that he should
disappear. Sometimes I hope that&mdash;&mdash;” She
stopped, and after a pause continued, “It seems too
dreadful a thing to say, but I cannot help feeling it.
Dick Bracknell behaved shamefully to me. Apart
from all that has happened since, I can never forgive
the humiliation of my marriage. It is the
simple truth that I should be glad to know that I
was free, even if it were by Dick’s death. But I
cannot feel that he is dead. Something tells me
that he is alive. That we shall yet meet&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I devoutly hope not,” broke in Babette fervently,
“for if we do I shall be tempted to&mdash;to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To what?” asked Joy sharply.</p>

<p>“To shoot him myself,” answered the other
grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Babette!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you need not look so shocked,” continued
Babette. “You and I have lived in the North, and
we know that justice does not always follow the
forms of law. And what is it that man Kipling
says, ‘There’s never a Law of God or man runs
North of fifty-three.’ We’re North of fifty-three
at North Star, and a law unto ourselves. If Dick
Bracknell is still alive, and came worrying you, I
think that I could&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Babette, you must not say it.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will not. But all the same I feel
that I could, for the man is worthless, mere vermin
like the wolves in the North. And that woman
Lady Alcombe, of whom you told me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She is dead! I learned that in England. She
was killed in a motor accident.”</p>

<p>“It was too merciful an end for her!” said
Babette quickly. “She ought to have lived to feel
remorse gnawing at her heart day by day and hour
by hour&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lady Alcombe was not the kind of woman to
suffer that way,” said Joy slowly. “She had no
heart.... But here comes the rain. We shall
have to go below.”</p>

<p class="p2">Nine days later Joy Gargrave walked across the
snow to the headquarters of the Mounted Police at
Regina, and asked, to see the Commissioner. He,
as it appeared, was absent, and the only official
immediately available was an inspector, a pleasant
soldier-like man in the early thirties. To him she
addressed her question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you tell me anything as to the whereabouts
of Corporal Bracknell?”</p>

<p>The inspector looked up from her card, and
flashed a keen glance at her, then shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Miss Gargrave. We should be
glad of news of Bracknell ourselves. He went on
a journey several weeks ago, and a patrol that has
come through the district where he was likely to be
has heard nothing of him, though a sled was found
which was unquestionably his. There were the
bones of dogs also, so that things look rather black.
The timber-wolves may have got him. Reports
from two or three districts state they have been
very savage this winter.”</p>

<p>Joy’s face went white, but she kept herself in
hand.</p>

<p>“Still I suppose there is a possibility that he may
have escaped?”</p>

<p>“A bare possibility,” answered the inspector in a
voice that betrayed he had little hope. Then he
asked suddenly, “I wonder why you wish to find
him, Miss Gargrave?”</p>

<p>Joy flushed at the question which to her seemed
to border on impertinence.</p>

<p>“It is a private matter,” she answered shortly.</p>

<p>“Please do not be offended, Miss Gargrave. I
had a reason for asking. You are the second person
to make inquiry about Corporal Bracknell this
week.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said Joy, growing suddenly alert.</p>

<p>“Yes, a gentleman came here with the same question
four days ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you see him? Would you mind telling me
what he was like?”</p>

<p>The inspector laughed. “There is no reason
why I should not, as it is not a police matter. I can
do better than give you his description. I can give
you his name, for I have his card somewhere.” He
fumbled among some papers on the desk, and in a
moment found what he sought. “Here it is!
Adrian Rayner, Albany Chambers, London.”</p>

<p>“Adrian Rayner!”</p>

<p>As Joy echoed the name, the inspector glanced at
her keenly. “You knew him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied slowly. “He is my cousin&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the officer politely, and then
added, “Mr. Rayner was anxious to learn where
Corporal Bracknell was, but on learning that Bracknell
was missing, he did not seem greatly perturbed.
I gathered that Mr. Rayner was a lawyer and that
it was on legal business that he wished to see Bracknell.”</p>

<p>To Joy it seemed as if the inspector was openly
fishing for information, and for one brief moment
she hesitated. Should she take him into her confidence,
and tell him all? She was strongly tempted
to do so, but in the end decided against it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, rising from her chair, “he is a
lawyer, and as Corporal Bracknell’s cousin has been
killed in England, it is possible that legal business
had brought him here. I am greatly obliged to
you, Inspector Graham.” She paused, and then
added, “I have a little request to make. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
receive any news of Corporal Bracknell will you
send it to me at North Star?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the inspector. “But I am
afraid you will be some time in receiving it.” He
smiled. “As you know, it is something more than
a crow’s flight from here to your home.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of a special courier,” said Joy
quickly. “There will be men to be found, and the
expense is nothing to me.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the inspector, “I will see
that you get whatever news reaches us at the earliest
moment! We of the force are too much indebted
to your late father and yourself to refuse
a trifling request of that kind. There is nothing
else that I can do for you, Miss Gargrave?”</p>

<p>Again Joy hesitated. Should she tell him what
she thought was the real object of Adrian Rayner’s
journey? Sitting there in that quiet room, she suddenly
felt that her suspicions would sound ridiculous
if put into words. After all, she had so very little
to go upon.</p>

<p>“Thank you! There is nothing.”</p>

<p>A moment later, Inspector Graham stood at his
window watching her cross the snow. He smiled a
little to himself.</p>

<p>“Um!” he muttered, “if Bracknell is still alive he
is in the way of being a lucky fellow.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Joy found Miss La Farge in
their room at the hotel.</p>

<p>“Babette,” she said, “we shall have to hurry.
Adrian Rayner is already here. He is four days
ahead of us. We must leave Regina within an
hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered her foster-sister, “as Mr. Rayner
is evidently in a hurry, we must hurry also. Is
there any news of Corporal Bracknell?”</p>

<p>“None, except that his sled has been found.”</p>

<p>“Ah! That is bad, very bad!”</p>

<p>“You must not think that, Babette,” cried Joy a
little wildly. “We must search. I will not give
up hope. I will find him.”</p>

<p>Her voice quivered and broke, and suddenly she
buried her face in her hands. Miss La Farge
looked at her for a moment with eyes brimming
with sympathy. Then she took a step forward and
placed her hand on her foster-sister’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Joy, my dear, what is the corporal to you?”</p>

<p>“To me,” Joy looked up with confusion in her
bearing. “How can he be anything to me? How
can any man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yet if we do not find him, it will be very bitter?”</p>

<p>“As bitter as death!” answered Joy, hiding her
face once more.</p>

<p>“Then we must certainly find him,” answered
Miss La Farge gravely. “And by way of a start,
I will talk to the clerk about trains.”</p>

<p>She turned and passed from the room, leaving
her foster-sister in tears. After a little time Joy
looked up. An absent gaze came in her tear-stained
eyes.</p>

<p>“If I only knew!” she whispered to herself, “if I
only knew!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ENCOUNTER AT THE LODGE</p>

<p class="drop-cap05"><span class="beg">IT WAS MID-DAY</span>, and as they marched between
the high banks on a hard trail, Joy Gargrave’s
heart grew light.</p>

<p>“Another hour, Babette, and we shall be home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply, “home! That is what
North Star is to us, and I wonder you ever left it,
Joy.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid,” answered Joy. “Dick Bracknell’s
letter startled me. He plainly meant to assert
himself and I was glad of Sir Joseph’s summons
to England, because it helped me to get away from
the complications here.”</p>

<p>“It does not matter much where one goes,”
answered Babette philosophically, “one carries
one’s real complications with her. Here or there&mdash;what
matters? The heart is ever the same.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” answered Joy, thinking of the
complications of her own life. “We are the victims
of our emotions quite as much as of circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Of our inexperience more than our emotions, I
should say,” answered Babette&mdash; “of our inexperience
and the ruthlessness of those who are prepared
to take advantage of them. But here, better than
in most places, we can live our own life, untrammelled,
and for the most part free from the worser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
cares. This lodge of ours is like a sanctuary in the
wilderness, and the serenity, the woods, the snow
and the silences have their own healing for the
troubles of life.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but there is something to be said for companionship
with one’s own kind. I notice we are
always a little excited when we have callers at the
Lodge. We&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A rifle shot cracked in on her words, and before
either of them could speak again, a moose broke
suddenly from the woods, and plunged down the
steep bank not five hundred yards ahead of them.
The wolf-dogs in the sleds gave tongue, and notwithstanding
the burden behind them, leaped forward.
Joy laughed gaily.</p>

<p>“There’s an end of philosophic reflection. The
moose is hit. I wonder who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A man emerged from the woods, dropped on one
knee, and sighted the wide-horned beast. Then his
shot rang, and the moose toppled over in the snow.
The hunter stood up and caught sight of the oncoming
party. He scrutinized it carefully for a
moment and then waved his hand.</p>

<p>“It is George,” cried Babette, naming an Indian
servant. “See, he recognizes us.”</p>

<p>The hunter descended the bank, and instead of
going to inspect his kill waited for them to come up.
As they did so a smile crumpled his grave copper-coloured
face.</p>

<p>“How!” he said. “Very glad to see you, Miss
Joy and Miss Babette. My words are not as my
heart, for my tongue is not easy of speech. But
glad am I to behold you, glad as if your coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
were the breath of the south spring wind upon the
cheek.”</p>

<p>Joy laughed with pleasure. “Not more glad
than are we, George. And you must not belittle
that tongue of yours. If you only knew it you talk
poetry. But tell me, how are things at the Lodge?
All right, I hope, and Nanette and the papoose,
they are well?”</p>

<p>“They are well,” answered the Indian. “But
we dwell not alone. With us are Rayner and two
men of the Kwikpak tribe. They are bad men.”</p>

<p>“Rayner!” as she echoed the name Joy’s eyes
flashed fire.</p>

<p>“Yes, with two bad men of the Kwikpak tribe.”</p>

<p>“When did they arrive?” asked Joy quickly.</p>

<p>“At nightfall five days ago. They were very
weary, having followed the trail hard and long.
Rayner brought word from you that he stay to look
for some man, but he brought no word of your coming.”</p>

<p>“No, I dare say not,” answered Joy sharply.
“He would not expect us so soon. We also have
pushed the trail hard. What has Mr. Rayner been
doing since he arrived, George?”</p>

<p>“The first day he rest and smoke and ask many
questions.”</p>

<p>“Questions? About what?”</p>

<p>“He asked if Nanette or I have beheld two men,
one of whom is Corporal Bracknell, who took the
Northward trail when you went southward. He
ask if we have seen him since that time, and I
answer no, for it is the truth, and Rayner he smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to himself as is the way of a man with a hidden
thought.”</p>

<p>“And the second man of whom he asked?”</p>

<p>“I know him not!” answered the Indian, “neither
him nor the name of Dick which he bore.”</p>

<p>“Dick!” Joy swung round to her companion.
“You hear, Babette. He asks after Dick, whose
body, as he told me, he had thrust into an ice-hole.
I thought when he told me that he lied and now I
know.”</p>

<p>She turned to the Indian again. “And the other
days?”</p>

<p>“The other days,” answered the Indian gravely,
“he drink much brandy and a little coffee, and the
two bad men they go on a journey and return yesterday.
They bring news I think, for at dawn tomorrow
they depart with Rayner.”</p>

<p>“No! Not tomorrow,” cried Joy, “but this
very day.”</p>

<p>“That will be as you desire, mistress. When we
return&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where are they going? Do you know,
George?”</p>

<p>“They take the Northward trail. Rayner tell
me that when he have drunk much brandy. ‘From
North Star to the North Star we go,’ he say, ‘you
old graven image, and when we come back the girl
shall be ours!’ I do not understand such words,
for there is no girl there, but such are the words
that Rayner speak.”</p>

<p>Joy looked at Babette. “He knows something,”
she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered her foster-sister, “but there is
one thing he does not know, and that is a woman’s
heart. He surely cannot hope&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do not know what he may hope. I know what
I shall do. My cousin Adrian is intolerable in his
pretensions.”</p>

<p>“What will you do, Joy? I begin to fancy that
away from the restraints of civilization Adrian
Rayner is possibly a dangerous man. And we are
‘North of fifty-three!’”</p>

<p>“I do not care. I am not afraid. There is, as
you once hinted, the law of the wilderness, and at
least I will be mistress in my own house.” She
turned to her servant. “We will leave you one of
the sleds, George. You will then be able to bring
some of the meat home. I will talk with you
again when you arrive.”</p>

<p>She gave orders for one team to push on and one
to remain, then as she and her foster-sister recommenced
their march she spoke again.</p>

<p>“I wonder why Adrian Rayner has lingered so
long at North Star?”</p>

<p>“He has evidently been using the Lodge as his
headquarters whilst he made the necessary inquiries.
Also there is another possibility,” answered
Babette.</p>

<p>“And what is that?”</p>

<p>“I have a thought that he may be desirous of
assuring himself that you have arrived here. It is
only a possibility, but it is there.”</p>

<p>“I do not see why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why do you suppose he wished to marry you?”
asked Babette quickly. “Because he loved you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Possibly! But you are a rich woman, and I think
that may have more to do with the question than
you have yet thought. It may have more to do
with his journey here than anything else. Have
you made a will, Joy?”</p>

<p>“No!” answered Joy quickly. “I have never
thought of it. My uncle never suggested it to
me.”</p>

<p>“That is not surprising,” was the answer.
“After Dick Bracknell, your uncle is your next of
kin. He and your cousin are your only blood relatives.
Without a will, your marriage being unknown,
your estate would fall to them if you were
to die.”</p>

<p>Joy’s face showed a dawning horror. “Oh, but
my uncle&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your uncle is human, Joy, and what is more he
has his difficulties. Whilst we were at Claridge’s I
overheard two men talking. I said nothing to you
at the time, regarding it as mere gossip, but they
were discussing Sir Joseph, and one of them said
that he had gathered some confounded bad eggs
during the last year or two, and that he must be
very rich to stand it. Supposing he is not very rich.
Supposing the bad eggs are more than he can stand.
Then your money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But I cannot think that of my uncle, Babette; it
is monstrous.”</p>

<p>“Of your uncle. No! Perhaps not! But your
cousin is another matter. Let us suppose that he
knows of Sir Joseph’s losses. We know he is not
scrupulous. Knowing of your marriage to Dick
Bracknell, he paid you attention. He asked you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
marry him. He even stooped to threats, as you
told me. Why? Because he wanted to be able to
control your fortune, to keep the money, some of
which was badly needed. You may shake your
head, Joy, but that is at least a possibility; and
that is why I suggest that it is possible that Adrian
Rayner may be desirous of assuring himself of your
arrival here. You are beginning to know him; do
you think that after his attempt to lure you into a
bigamous marriage, and after his threats, that he
will be at all chary of using any means that circumstances
may offer of putting him in possession of
your fortune? I do not! And he has been drinking,
if what George says is true; and drink makes a
tempted man dangerous. You must be careful,
Joy, even diplomatic if necessary.”</p>

<p>“I shall order him to leave North Star the moment
we arrive there!” answered Joy stubbornly.
“If there is a shadow of truth in your surmises,
there is all the more reason why I should do so.”</p>

<p>“You will do as you please, Joy,” replied her
foster-sister, breaking into a smile, “and at any rate
we have the big battalions on our side. With the
drivers and George, and George’s son, Jim, we
shall be able to enforce your will.”</p>

<p>“And I shall do so,” answered Joy. “Here I
am strong enough to disregard his threats.”</p>

<p>As it happened, the first person they encountered
when they left the river trail and swung into the
clearing which led to the Lodge, was Adrian Rayner.
He was walking towards the river, with a
rifle in the crook of his arm, and as he saw them
swinging towards him, he halted suddenly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
remained quite still, until Joy reached him. The
look on his face betrayed his surprise, and to Joy it
was clear that he had not expected to encounter her
before his departure from the lodge. He stood
there a little nonplussed and it was Joy who spoke
first.</p>

<p>“You have not wasted time, Cousin Adrian,” she
said, and there was an unmistakable edge to her
tones.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered with an awkward laugh. “I
promised you I would find that man who was in the
wood when you shot your hus&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No!” she interrupted sharply, “not when I did,
but when you shot my husband!”</p>

<p>There was accusation in her eyes, her voice, and
Rayner visibly quailed before it. Then he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>“What confounded nonsense is this?”</p>

<p>“It is not nonsense,” she answered. “It is at
least a possibility. You were in the wood that
night, and you had a rifle with you. There were
two shots, and one of them hit Dick Bracknell.
One of those shots came from my rifle, but from
whose rifle did the second come? Yours! I say.”</p>

<p>“Mine!” he cried harshly. “You must be mad.
You cannot have thought over what you are saying.”</p>

<p>“No,” she countered, “I am not mad, I am quite
sane, and I have thought a great deal over the
matter.”</p>

<p>“But why should I shoot Dick Bracknell masquerading
as Koona Dick? He was not my husband?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Joy coolly, “but he was mine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
you had somehow become aware of the fact. If I
am not mistaken, you yourself aspired to marry
me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Men <i>are</i> sometimes smitten with madness,” he
interposed sneeringly. “But there is another possibility
that I can suggest to you, of which you do
not seem to have thought. That precious corporal
who was here; he had a gun! Also, I fancy
that he would find the death of Dick Bracknell no
heartbreaking business, as it would bring him
within a step of the succession to Harrow Fell; and
as Jeff Bracknell is now dead, it puts him absolutely
on the doorstep. Have you thought of that?”</p>

<p>“There is no need that I should,” answered Joy
promptly. “Roger Bracknell had no knowledge
that the man whom he knew as Koona Dick was
his cousin, until he picked up a note which Dick had
written to me, which was some time after the firing
had taken place. I know that, and your suggestion
is merely preposterous.”</p>

<p>“You think so,” he laughed. “I wonder why?”
Something in his tones brought the blood flaming
to Joy Gargrave’s face. Her eyes flashed indignantly.
Rayner laughed again brutally.</p>

<p>“Not that there is any need for wonder,” he said
maliciously. “You seem to be in great vogue with
the Bracknells. It must be a family weakness for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How dare you?” She took a step forward,
and suddenly raised the dog whip in her hand.
Rayner backed quickly, and instinctively raised his
hand. But the long lash smote him on the face,
and he gave vent to a savage oath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“You&mdash;virago! Would you?”</p>

<p>He had lost complete control of himself, and
what would have happened is only to be conjectured,
but at that moment the Indian George stepped
quietly from behind some tall bushes. He still
carried his rifle, and though there was an impassive
look on his brown face, his eyes were blazing.
The white man saw him, and as he met those eyes,
the wrath in him was checked. The Indian spoke
no word, but very deliberately opened the breech
of his rifle, as if to assure himself that it was
loaded. Then he closed it and looked at Rayner
again, and at that second look the white man shivered,
for in it he saw something threatening and
ominous, which unsealed the springs of fear within
him. Joy was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“George,” she said, addressing her henchman,
“Mr. Rayner takes the trail in an hour. Anything
he needs for his journey he is to have; but he
goes within the hour, and never again is he to visit
North Star. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>The Indian nodded his head in grave assent, and
without another look at Adrian Rayner, Joy
turned and went up the road towards the house.</p>

<p class="pch">THE CORPORAL HEARS NEWS</p>

<p class="drop-cap07"><span class="beg">DURING</span> the weeks of his convalescence in
Chief Louis’ smoking tepee, Roger Bracknell
spent much of his time in reflecting on
the news which the chief had given him. Reviewing
the story calmly and dispassionately, he could
find nothing to weaken the conclusion which the
half-breed himself had reached. The dynamite
and the winter thunder, with the description of the
broken trail and the strange conduct of the unknown
man in deliberately over-running Rolf Gargrave’s
camp, were almost conclusive evidence.
Some one had planned that Rolf Gargrave should
die; and his death had been as surely a murder as
if the man who had planned it had taken a rifle
with which to do the deed. Who was the man?</p>

<p>As often as he asked himself this question, the
corporal found his thoughts reverting to his cousin.
Had Dick Bracknell, having married Rolf Gargrave’s
daughter, deliberately planned the murder
of the millionaire? His heart revolted at the
thought, but he could not escape from it. Dick
had been hard pressed. He was already a fugitive
from justice when he had arrived in the North and,
so far as the corporal knew, that arrival had been
a secret one. He would be quite unknown&mdash;even
to Rolf Gargrave. No one would suspect him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and the plan he had chosen was itself so novel, that
but for the Indians noticing his absence from the
camp, and carrying the sticks of dynamite back to
Chief Louis, it must have escaped detection.</p>

<p>The more the corporal thought of it, the more
black seemed the case against his cousin. Rolf
Gargrave was a clever man, and powerful, and he
had had his own plans for his daughter. Dick
Bracknell must have known that when he heard
how Joy had been trapped into marriage, he would
be very wrathful, and calculating on the father’s
intervention he must have decided to get rid of
him, in the hope of sooner or later trading upon
Joy’s inexperience of the world. One day, whilst
he was reflecting on the problem, unable to touch
certainty anywhere, a thought occurred to him,
and when Chief Louis entered the tepee he
promptly asked a question&mdash;</p>

<p>“Louis, when was it that the stranger called at
your camp for guides to help him to find Rolf Gargrave?
I mean what time of the year was it?”</p>

<p>The chief considered for a moment. Then he
answered gravely. “It was two moons before ze
ice break up.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?” asked the corporal.</p>

<p>“Certain!”</p>

<p>“That would be March or a little later,” said
the corporal thoughtfully. “And Dick fled from
England about Christmas. If he came straight
through he might do it comfortably.”</p>

<p>“Dick! Who ees dat?” asked the chief quickly.</p>

<p>“He is the one man I know who may have been
interested in Rolf Gargrave’s death. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
have heard of him? He is known in the North as
Koona Dick!”</p>

<p>“I hav’ not him seen, unless he vas ze stranger
mans who come to my camp dat day. But of him I
hav’ heard. He is bad mans, he want shooting.
He sell whiskey&mdash;mooch whiskey, to ze Porcupine
Sticks, an’ dey fight till seven be dead in ze snow.
Also he take their catch of fur for ze whiskey, an’
when ze winter it come, dey freeze, an’ ze babes
die. Yes, of him, I have heard, an’ he is very bad
mans. So he is ze mans dat come to my lodges dat
day, an’ dat blow up ze trail for Rolf Gargrave
so dat he die.”</p>

<p>“I have not said so yet,” answered the corporal
thoughtfully, “but I am afraid that there can be
little question of it. Some day when I meet him I
shall put the question to him plainly, and learn the
truth.”</p>

<p>“You know dis mans, Koona Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes! He is my cousin.”</p>

<p>As he received the information the half-breed
flashed a quick glance of sympathy.</p>

<p>“Le diable!” he said. “Dat is strange. But
so it does befall. One pup of ze litter he ees a
good dog, and he grows to ze collar-work naturally;
but anoder he is bad, he snarl like ze wolf, he
is a thief, he will not do ze work. So is it with ze
sled-dogs and with men! It is passing strange, but
I hev’ often beheld it, and it is so!”</p>

<p>The corporal nodded his assent. He had often
wondered at the crooked strain which had sent his
cousin on wild courses to dishonour, but could find
no consolation in the thought that given certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
circumstances the way of dishonour was almost
inevitable. He rose from the couch of skins, and
moving stiffly towards the fire, thrust in a spruce
twig, and with it lit his pipe. Then he turned to
the chief.</p>

<p>“I wonder how soon I shall be able to take the
trail, Louis?”</p>

<p>The half-breed shook his head. “Not yet. Ze
leg dat hav’ been broken, it is not good for snow-shoe
work. No! It ache like le diable! You
must wait&mdash;wait till ze ice break up, then you go
down ze river in a canoe. Dat will be ze easy way.
Yes.”</p>

<p>A mutinous look came on Roger Bracknell’s
face. Having so long lived an active life, he was
growing tired of the monotony of the encampment,
and as he felt the strength returning to his leg was
more and more inclined to make the attempt to
reach civilization as represented by the police-post.
There was news to send to Joy Gargrave, news
that might profoundly affect her life, and it was
desirable that she should receive it at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p>“I do not think that I shall wait until then,
Louis. They will give me up for lost, at the
post, and besides I have news for a certain
person&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is the news good?” interrupted the chief. For
a moment the corporal did not reply. Was the
news he had to send Joy Gargrave good? In one
way, yes! It would suffice to remove any lingering
doubt as to the effect of the shot that she had fired
when she had gone to meet Dick Bracknell in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
wood. He would be able to assure her, on the
evidence of Dick himself, that she was not responsible
for the mischief that had been done. That
assurance, as he knew, would mean the lifting of a
weight of apprehension from Joy’s heart. In
another way, however, the news was bad. Dick
Bracknell was still alive, and that meant that she
was still bound to him, and that on the first favourable
opportunity he might assert himself. His
mind was still balancing the good and evil of the
case, when Louis, who had been watching his face,
spoke again.</p>

<p>“There is no need to speak. Ze news it is not
good! Therefore there is not any cause for haste.
Ill news does not grow worse for keeping, and the
trail it is bad these days, for there is mooch snow.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I shall make the endeavour,
Louis! I will borrow a man and a dog team and
meat from you, and in one week I will take the
trail. If I find it too much for me, I can return.”</p>

<p>The chief nodded. “As you please. Ze dogs
are yours, also ze meat an ze mans, though ze hunters
are from ze camp just now. But if you mus’
go, you mus’. It is le diable in ze race that drives
you forth, corp’ral.”</p>

<p>“The devil in the race?” laughed Bracknell.
“I do not understand, Louis. What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean ze unrest that dwells in ze men of your
tribe. It drives them forth, for good or ill, to ze
conquest of ze lands. It makes them seek ze stick
which runs through ze earth&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“The pole, you mean, Louis.”</p>

<p>“Ze pole, yes! And when got, what good?
It makes them dat they cannot sit by ze fires in
warm tepees, but must go hunt ze bald-faced bear,
or dig ze frozen earth for gold dat somewhere
white squaw may fling it from ze window.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” laughed the corporal. “You put the
truth&mdash;rather brutally. We are rather given that
way. But it isn’t the devil, Louis, it is the genius
and instinct of our race for conquest that drives us&mdash;that
and the dream of the home-woman, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Chief Louis nodded. “Oui! maybe; and you
haf’ ze dream corp’ral.”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell stopped his perambulation
of the hut, and stared at his companion.</p>

<p>“Now how the dickens do you know that,
Louis?”</p>

<p>“I have seen it in your eyes. You speak of Rolf
Gargrave, an’ twice, only twice you hav’ speak of
Gargrave’s daughter, but there were dreams in ze
eyes then, and a soft note in ze voice, and I know
dat she is what you call ze home-woman. Oui! I
know dat is so.”</p>

<p>The corporal’s face flushed, and he did not deny
it. For one moment as he stood there, he had a
vision of Joy Gargrave, young and beautiful and a
fit mate for any man, and in that moment there
were dreams in his eyes. Three seconds later
realities asserted themselves, and the soft light
died from his eyes. He gave a little bitter laugh,
and without speaking resumed his perambulations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Chief Louis watched him for a moment then he
said tentatively, “There be difficulties ahead, corp’ral.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Bracknell, “grave difficulties!
What would you do, Louis, if you wanted a maid
to wife?”</p>

<p>“I should offer a large price&mdash;blankets, guns,
tobac!”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell laughed at the notion of offering
a large price for Joy Gargrave, and then
mooted the real difficulty.</p>

<p>“But if it was not a matter of price, Louis,
rather of another man! What then?”</p>

<p>“Then I would him fight. Always maidens are
caught with strength. They love a man. Dat is
ze law of life and of mating. Ze strong wolf in ze
pack he hav’ ze pick an’ ze strong bull-moose he
hav’ ze herd; an’ ze strong man he take ze maid.
I have looked on ze world and so is it! Yes!
Love like all dings else is ze spoil of ze strong!”</p>

<p>Bracknell did not reply for a moment. In that
hour the law of the primeval wilds appealed to him
strongly, but he knew that it was not the way for
him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “it is the law of the wilds, but
not of my race. I carry a law that is the law of
man, and he who kills whether for love or hate dies
therefor. The thing is impossible!”</p>

<p>Chief Louis grunted disapprobation. “Ze law
of ze wild is better. For dat reason I dwell in ze
lodges of my mother’s people, where ze strong
rule.”</p>

<p>He knocked the ashes from his pipe, and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
adding more passed out of the tepee. Roger
Bracknell still continued his perambulations, exercising
his injured leg, and as he walked his mind
was busy with what he felt was to become the problem
of his life. He loved Joy Gargrave. He
confessed it frankly to himself. He had loved her
since that day when in the woods at North Star she
had offered him her hand as a token that she
counted him among her friends! But what good
was it? The whole thing was so hopeless so long
as Dick Bracknell lived. And if he died, would
the outlook be any the less hopeless? He could
not tell, but he was afraid not; for friendship was
not love, and Joy Gargrave, as he was sure, was
not a woman to give her affection easily.</p>

<p>As he thought despair gripped him, and the
tepee’s skin walls seemed too narrow a prison-house.
He threw on his fur coat and mittens and
went outside. Driven by his thoughts, he left the
encampment, and, walking stiffly, moved down the
river trail. He had walked perhaps a mile and a
half, when out of the woods broke a couple of
laden sledges, and two men of the tribe. They
were from the hunters, and as they passed they
saluted him gravely, according to the manner of
their race.</p>

<p>“How! How!”</p>

<p>He responded in kind, and continued to walk on.
He had proceeded but a little way however when a
thought occurred to him. These men had been
away on the main river. They might have news of
the outer world. Instantly as the thought came to
him, he turned in his tracks and began to return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the encampment. When he reached there the two
hunters were not to be seen, but when he entered
his own tepee he found Chief Louis sitting by the
fire, smoking. There was an impassive look on his
face, but in his eyes was a light that could not be
hidden, and the white man knew that the chief was
excited. The corporal did not remark upon
the fact, however, but deliberately filled his pipe,
and seating himself, smoked on as if he had noticed
nothing. After a little time Louis spoke.</p>

<p>“Ze hunters they hav’ sent meat, mooch meat!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bracknell. “I met two men
of the tribe just now.”</p>

<p>“There is meat for a potlach (feast), but dat is
not ze way of my people. We are not as ze
wolves which eat all, even ze bones, an’ then run
hungry until a new kill is made.”</p>

<p>“There is much wisdom in such prudence,” answered
Bracknell, wondering when the half-breed
would unfold his news.</p>

<p>“It is ze way of ze white mans, and it is ze way
of ze wise, therefore do we eat and leave meat that
we may eat again.”</p>

<p>The corporal nodded, but said nothing, and
after a pause Chief Louis spoke again. “Of ze
two men you met, one was Sibou.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Sibou, who with Paslik went as guide
with the stranger who wished to overtake Rolf
Gargrave?”</p>

<p>“Oui! Sibou, who went with ze stranger mans
who blow ze bottom out of ze trail that Rolf Gargrave
die!”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell waited. He felt that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
on the verge of some revelation, but he concealed
his impatience and maintained an unperturbed
demeanour, knowing that such would commend
him to his host. The half-breed puffed stolidly at
his pipe for a full minute, then he spoke again.</p>

<p>“Sibou brings not meat alone, he brings
news.”</p>

<p>“News.”</p>

<p>“Oui! Of ze stranger mans who dynamite ze
trail!”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Dat is ze news which Sibou bring to me. He
say dat six days ago, ze stranger mans come to ze
hunting camp to buy meat. He have with him fine
dogs and two bad Indians. He offer for meat one
good rifle and many cartridges, an’ Sibou sell him
meat. Also he know him for ze stranger mans;
but ze stranger he does not know Sibou, whose face
was last winter mauled by a bald-faced grizzly to
whom he did not give ze trail. The stranger mans
he camp with the hunters for ze night, and ze two
Indians they smoke with Sibou and ask questions,
many questions.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bracknell, as the chief paused.
“What about?”</p>

<p>“hey ask about a white mans of ze name of
Koona Dick!”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!”</p>

<p>“Also they ask if anything be known of anoder
white mans a policemans who is lost, an’ Sibou,
whose tongue is a silent one, ask ze name of ze
policemans.”</p>

<p>“Did he get it?” asked the corporal quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oui! Ze name was Corporal Bracknell, which
is you.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, yes! But who&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The half-breed checked him by raising his hand,
and continued, “Sibou hav’ in mind dat ze trail was
blown up for Rolf Gargrave, and he is cautious.
He told of your sled which was found, and of ze
dead wolves, but he say nodings dat we find you an’
dat you are with me; and presently the two bad Indians
go back to the stranger mans who is in a tepee
which Sibou has set for him. Sibou he follow, and
he lie in ze snow outside ze tepee, and with his
knife he cut a hole in the tepee dat he may see and
hear. Ze stranger mans is by ze fire, and Sibou
see ze face of him, whilst his men talk. When
they tell of ze sled and ze dead wolves, ze white
mans he smile as a man well pleased; an’ dat is
everything, except dat next morning he go north
with ze meat he hav’ bartered for. Such is ze tale
of Sibou. What tink you, corporal?”</p>

<p>“Think! It is no time for thinking, it is the
time for action. There’s some infernal work
afoot, and I start on that man’s trail tomorrow.
Whatever his game may be now&mdash;and it’s a mystery
that passes my comprehension&mdash;he’s the murderer
of Rolf Gargrave, and I’ll get him if I follow
him to the Pole! But the story puzzles me!
Those Indians asked about Koona Dick. Why
should they do that?”</p>

<p>The chief shook his head. “Dat I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“It’s odd, very odd! Koona Dick is the one
man who may reasonably be suspected of a motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
for getting rid of Rolf Gargrave. That I know,
but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off as a thought occurred to him, and
then remarked thoughtfully, “The question may
have been a mere bluff of Dick’s. He may after
all have recognized Sibou and set his men to ask the
question in order to discover whether your man
had any knowledge of his name! Yes, that may
be it! But I will find him, and I will learn the
truth. Louis, can I have a team and stores for
the morning? And Sibou also? He knows the
man and I do not. Of course the service will be
paid for from Regina.”</p>

<p>The chief nodded his head. “Ze dogs are
yours, with the stores, also Sibou goes with you.
But you will find ze trail hard, for dat leg he is not
yet strong.”</p>

<p>“It will grow stronger every day, and with Sibou
to pack the trail I shall do well. I start at dawn
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Louis, rising, “I will go, and ze
teams select for you. Ze dogs shall be of ze best.”</p>

<p>He went out leaving Roger Bracknell in a whirl
of conflicting thoughts.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">A LONELY CABIN</p>

<p class="drop-cap06"><span class="beg">CORPORAL BRACKNELL</span> and Sibou had
left the hunting camp of the tribe two days
and were following the trail of the white
man and the two Indians who had visited it more
than a week before. The trail, though it was old,
was well defined, for there had been no fall of
snow in the interval, and the frozen surface of the
wilderness kept the trail fresh, and made it easy to
follow. It was evident to both of them that their
quarry travelled fast, for the distances between the
camping places were greater than was usual, and it
was clear that those whom they followed had some
need for haste. What it could be the corporal
could only guess, and guessing under the circumstances
was not a very profitable occupation. And
there were other signs which gave room for speculation.
Now and again the party ahead of them
had halted for a little time, and two of the men had
left the dogs and the sled, as their tracks showed.
These halting places, as the corporal was quick to
observe, always occurred when some small stream
fell into the main river, or when some accessible
gully or creek opened from the banks.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, Sibou?” he asked
when they had reached the fifth halting place of
this sort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian who had followed the tracks of two
of the gullies to the point where they reversed
glanced at those which now lay before them.
Then he waved a mittened hand.</p>

<p>“These men be looking for something.”</p>

<p>“Or some one!” commented the corporal
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The Indian gave a grave inclination of his head.
“It is not good to follow every trail,” he said in
his own tongue. “Sometime perhaps we shall find
a trail that does not return on itself, then we know
they find what they seek and we follow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the corporal, “that is the best
way, I think. We will push on and not waste time
on these excursions.”</p>

<p>They pressed forward and passed two more of
these deviations from the main track without
troubling to follow them. Just before daylight
faded, when they were hugging the bank looking
for a suitable camping place, the Indian called the
corporal’s attention to a small creek the entrance
to which was masked by low-boughed spruce trees.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the corporal, “that should do.
Those banks and trees should break this wind.”</p>

<p>They turned the dogs towards it, and negotiating
a snow wreath which the wind was piling up,
they entered the sheltering creek. Sibou was
leading, packing the trail, and the corporal clinging
to the gee-pole of the sled, saw him come to a most
unexpected halt. Bracknell moved forward.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Sibou?”</p>

<p>The Indian did not speak, but pointed silently
at the snow, and looking down the corporal saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the unmistakable trail of snowshoes. The tracks
were quite fresh, and were so unexpected that
Bracknell was himself astonished. He stared at
them as Crusoe must have stared when he found
the footprints on the shore of his island. Who
had left that tell-tale trail? Perhaps a wandering
Indian. Maybe some solitary prospector caught
by winter, or possibly the man whom he was seeking,
the murderer of Rolf Gargrave. His heart
beat quickly at the thought and, still staring at the
trail which came down the bank of the creek and
then turned away from the river, he considered the
matter carefully, and then gave instructions.</p>

<p>“Follow it, Sibou, and find out where it goes
and who made it. I will pitch camp and wait
here for you.”</p>

<p>The Indian nodded gravely and departed and
Bracknell busied himself with pitching camp. He
had already lit the fire and fed the dogs, and was
busy with the beans and bacon when Sibou returned.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the corporal expectantly. “Did
you find him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply. “There is one Indian
and one white man. They are in a cabin at the
head of the creek.”</p>

<p>Bracknell was conscious of a sudden excitement.</p>

<p>“Did you see the white man? Is it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Sibou shook his head. “I saw him, but it is not
the man we follow; and he is very sick with the
coughing sickness!”</p>

<p>The corporal’s excitement died as quickly as it
had risen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you speak with him, Sibou?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the Indian. “There was no need.
I saw his face as he came to the cabin door. It is
not the man.”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell bent over the fire. He was
disappointed, but he did not show it. He turned
the bacon in the pan then he looked up.</p>

<p>“We will have supper first, then I will walk up
the creek as far as the cabin, and have a talk with
this white man. He may know something of the
man we follow.”</p>

<p>Sibou made no reply, and when the meal was
ready they ate it in silence, and smoked whilst they
drank the coffee. Then Bracknell arose.</p>

<p>“I go now, Sibou. I shall return before sleeping
time.”</p>

<p>The Indian offered no objection to this, and
knocking the ashes from his pipe the policeman
left the camp. Even in the darkness he had no difficulty
in following the trail up the creek, and presently
the smell of burning wood informed him
that he was in the neighbourhood of the cabin.
He looked round carefully and descried it in the
shadow of the trees on the right bank, and began
to ascend towards it. When he reached it there
was no clamour of dogs such as might have been
expected had there been a team there, and as he
rapped upon the door, he reflected that his conjecture
about the gold prospector overtaken by the
winter was probably the correct one.</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and a tall man whose
face he could not discern stood revealed. Inside
in front of a makeshift stove was another man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
who was taken suddenly by a paroxysm of coughing.
For half a minute the corporal stood there,
and the man at the door did not move or speak;
but at the end of that time, between two spasms of
coughing, the other man cried querulously, “Oh,
come in and shut that confounded door!”</p>

<p>The man at the door moved aside, and as Bracknell
entered, he closed the door behind him, and
stood with his back to it, staring at the new-comer
with eyes that had in them a savage gleam of hate.
The man by the fire was still coughing, and at the
end of some three minutes, as the cough left him,
he sat there, gasping and wheezing and utterly exhausted.
Roger Bracknell watched him, with
compassionate eyes. As he recognized, the man
was in sore straits, and that cough probably meant
that the coming of the Spring was for him the
coming of death. As his breath came back the
sick man half turned.</p>

<p>“Sit down, can’t&mdash;&mdash;” The remark was broken
off half way, and the man started from his seat.
“Great Christopher! A Daniel come to judgment!
How do you do, Cousin Roger?”</p>

<p>As the voice quivering with excitement rang
through the cabin, a startled look came on Roger
Bracknell’s face, and he bent forward, and stared
at the wasted features of the unkempt man before
him. The other laughed harshly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t stare so hard, Roger; it is I
right enough.”</p>

<p>It was Dick Bracknell, and as the corporal realized
the fact, the compassion he had felt for a
stranger was trebled when he found that the sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
man was of his own blood. For a moment he did
not reply, but with a shocked look on his face gazed
at the ravaged features before him. The “coughing
sickness” which Sibou had mentioned had
plainly gripped Dick Bracknell and marked him for
death. Some of his teeth were gone and the colour
of his gums appeared like yellow ochre in the
firelight. As he noted these signs of scurvy, the
corporal was moved to speak his pity.</p>

<p>“Dick, old man, I am mortal sorry&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then keep your infernal pity for yourself!”
cried the other savagely. “You’ll need it all in a
minute, for Joe has the drop on you, you&mdash;&mdash; murderer.”</p>

<p>The corporal started, and swung round. The
Indian, Joe, was standing with his back to the door,
and the glow of the fire was reflected from the
pistol in his hand. He noted the fact quite calmly,
and turned to his cousin again.</p>

<p>“Murderer?” he said slowly. “I do not understand.
What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“No?” snarled his cousin. “Well, look at me!
Would you say that I was a good case for a Life
Insurance Society?”</p>

<p>The corporal looked at him, and out of pity was
silent.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t be so particular,” continued
the other sneeringly. “I’ve seen other fellows
whose lungs have been chilled, and I know I am
booked, unless I can get to a sanatorium in double
quick time. And I know you have a soft heart, but
you should have let it speak sooner&mdash;before you
put this upon me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Before I put&mdash;&mdash; I do not know what you
mean?”</p>

<p>“No! But you know that you poisoned that
dog food that we took from you, don’t you? And
you can guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good God!” ejaculated the corporal, and the
astonishment in his face and voice did more than
any protests could have done to convince his cousin
that the charge was groundless.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know? No, I see you didn’t!”
cried the sick man.</p>

<p>“Of course I didn’t!” replied the policeman
quickly. “The dogs you left me died of poison at
my first camp, after they had been fed. I blamed
your man, because you had told me that he was
reluctant to let me go. Now it seems that I was
wrong, as you are wrong. Tell me what
happened?”</p>

<p>“I will,” said his cousin, “sit down!” As the
corporal seated himself on a log, Dick Bracknell
turned to the Indian. “You can put down that
pistol for the present, Joe. There’s a mystery to
be cleared up before there’s any shooting to be
done. Put it down, I tell you!”</p>

<p>The Indian obeyed reluctantly, but still stood
against the door, and Dick Bracknell explained.
“Joe there has it saved up against you. He was
sure that you had deliberately poisoned the dog
food, so that we should get stranded, and you, with
a new outfit, would be able to find us at your leisure.
I couldn’t believe it of you at first. It was such a
low-down game that I’d have sworn that nobody
but a Siwash half-breed would have played it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
But the logic of facts seemed convincing, and I’d
come to believe it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what happened.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy enough. When I parted from
you, I had an idea of working across to the
Behring, where I’d have been off the beat of your
confounded patrols. We travelled a week and
made a good pace, then one night Joe there fed the
dogs with the salmon-roe we took off your sled.
They were all dead within two hours; and there we
were, stranded in the shadow of the Arctic circle
and nearly a thousand miles from civilization.”
The sick man broke off, shaken by a fit of coughing,
and then as the spasm passed and his breath
returned, he said meditatively, “If you’d walked
into our camp then we’d have fed you with that roe,
and watched you twist as those dogs were twisted,
for Joe looked at the food and found strychnine,
which he’d used when he was trapping for the
H. B. C.... Lucky thing for you that you
didn’t! Did you say your dogs died of the same
thing?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the corporal slowly, “and now
I’m wondering who was responsible.”</p>

<p>“Somebody who was getting at you, and not at
us,” answered Dick Bracknell quickly, “for he
couldn’t have known that we should collar the
food. Had you been using the same stuff all
along?”</p>

<p>“No.” The word dropped from the corporal
reluctantly. “No. I had laid in a new stock at
North Star.”</p>

<p>“Then it was there the thing was done,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the sick man with conviction. “The question is,
who did it? Joy wouldn’t even dream of such a
thing!”</p>

<p>“That at any rate is quite certain!” answered the
corporal with conviction.</p>

<p>“But somebody did it; somebody who owed you
one, and meant to get rid of you. That’s shown
by the fact that your dogs did all right on the food
at the beginning. That which you used first
wasn’t tampered with, or the dogs would have died
at the first camp you made. But they didn’t, for
you camped with us, and I remember that more
than once, whilst we were waiting for my convalescence,
you fed your dogs with the roe. That is
positive proof that the top portion of the dog-food
was all right, it was only lower down that it had
been tampered with.”</p>

<p>“But why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s as plain as a barn-door. You were meant
to get well away on the trail, and one night you
would unknowingly feed the dogs with poisoned
roe. They would die, and unless you had wonderful
luck you would die too, long before you got
back to civilization. That is the amiable plan that
somebody thought out for you; and as things
turned out he nearly bagged me and Joe instead of
you.”</p>

<p>“But he almost got me too,” said the corporal
thoughtfully, and gave his cousin a brief account
of his adventures.</p>

<p>“You were lucky,” commented the sick man.
“A broken leg can be spliced, but who is going to
splice a set of frozen lungs?” His face grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
suddenly convulsed with passion, and he broke into
terrible oaths. “If I had the murderer here&mdash;but
who was he anyway?”</p>

<p>“There is only one man of whom I can think,
and before I tell you his name there are two questions
I should like to ask.”</p>

<p>“Fire them off!”</p>

<p>“The first is this, do you know anything of Rolf
Gargrave’s death?”</p>

<p>“I know that the bottom dropped out of the trail
and that he was drowned&mdash;nothing more.
What’s that got to do with it anyway?”</p>

<p>The corporal looked at his cousin. The haggard
face was clear of guilt, and in that moment
he knew that his earliest suspicions when Chief
Louis had told him the story of Rolf Gargrave’s
death had been utterly wrong. Whatever crimes
Dick Bracknell had to his account this was not one
of them.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain why I asked you in a moment,” he
answered. “There is the second question&mdash;yet;
and it is this, did you ever inform any one of your
marriage with Joy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, one man! When I heard that Rolf Gargrave
was dead, I wrote to England and informed
his legal adviser, Sir Joseph Rayner, that Joy and
I were husband and wife. I never had any answer
to the let&mdash;&mdash; But what’s the matter, man?
You look as if you had seen a ghost! What is it?”</p>

<p>There was a look of startled amazement on the
corporal’s face. He was staring at his cousin as
if what the latter had said was a revelation to him,
as indeed it was. A dark suspicion had leapt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
his mind, a suspicion that seemed almost incredible,
but which persisted and would not be thrust aside.
If Sir Joseph Rayner knew, then in all probability
his son also knew, and yet having that knowledge
he had suggested that the relation between himself
and Joy was such as justified his confessed aspiration
of making her his wife. Had he been responsible
for that second shot at North Star? Or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell’s voice broke in again querulously.</p>

<p>“What’s got you, Roger! Spit it out!”</p>

<p>“I can’t at present,” replied the corporal slowly.
“You’ve given me news that I must think over before
I talk. But there is one thing that I can tell
you, and that is that Rolf Gargrave did not die by
a mere accident. The trail he was following was
sound enough, but the ice was blown up by dynamite.
It froze over again in the night, and as I
gather there was a little snow, he went on to the
thin ice without suspicion, and went through.
That’s the story as I’ve recently heard it; and I’m
on the trail of the man who plotted the infernal
thing, now.”</p>

<p>The sick man pursed his lips to whistle, but no
sound came from them. Then he remarked, with
a little laugh of bitterness, “So that’s why you
asked if I knew anything of my father-in-law’s
death, is it?”</p>

<p>“It was just a suspicion that occurred to me,”
explained the corporal apologetically. “When I
heard the story I wondered who would benefit by
Gargrave’s death, and as you had just married Joy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and had fled here from England, it was a natural
suspicion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I must have got pretty low down for it to be
natural to suspect me of an infernal crime of that
sort,” was the other’s bitter comment. “But who
do you suspect now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know! As I told you, I’m after the
man. The trail’s a week old, but I’ll find him even
if I follow him to the rim of the Polar sea.”</p>

<p>“I hope to heaven you’ll get him, and that he’ll
swing at Regina for that job. I wonder if the
same man had anything to do with poisoning the
dog food.”</p>

<p>“I am wondering that also!” replied the corporal
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Any idea of the fellow?”</p>

<p>“Just a suspicion, nothing more. Not enough
to presume upon&mdash;yet!”</p>

<p>“He must have a mind that is diabolic.”</p>

<p>“So it would seem!” replied the corporal, and
after a little time his cousin spoke again.</p>

<p>“Many a time while I have sat here wheezing
and coughing, I have cursed you from my heart,
but now I could pray that you come up with that
man, and make him pay for it all. If I were sure
you’d get him I could go cheerfully to my appointed
place in the pit.”</p>

<p>“I shall get him,” answered the corporal with
conviction. “The Indian who is with me was with
him when he arranged for Gargrave’s death, and
if my suspicions have any bottom in them, then I
know him myself.”</p>

<p>“You’ll push on in the morning, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Before daylight! And I shall come up with
the man, never fear. He’s travelling fast, but he’s
looking for some thing or some one, the latter, I
think, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose he’s looking for?”</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s the man I suspect, I shouldn’t
wonder if he were looking for you.”</p>

<p>“For me! What in thunder for?”</p>

<p>“To finish what he began that night when you
were shot at North Star!”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Do you mean that he was the
man who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It seems to me to be more than likely. He is
the man round whom all these mysteries seem to
centre.”</p>

<p>“What is the blighter?” asked the other quickly.</p>

<p>“That I must keep to myself for a little time.
I may be mistaken, you know. But if I am not&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll let me know? You’ll give me the satisfaction
of knowing that the fellow will pay for
these lungs of mine?” cried the sick man eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the corporal pityingly. “I will
let you know.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later as he left the cabin his face
wore a set look that boded ill for the man on
whose trail he followed.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">ADRIAN RAYNER’S STORY</p>

<p class="drop-cap04"><span class="beg">“JOE</span>, I thought I heard the yelping of dogs.
Did you hear anything?”</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head and Dick Bracknell
sank back on his improvised couch of spruce,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he muttered, “I’m dreaming. No,
by Jove! I’m not. There it is again. Don’t
you hear it, Joe?” This time the Indian nodded
and going to the door of the cabin looked down the
creek. Three men and a dog sled were coming up
the trail. He turned and informed Bracknell of
the fact. A thoughtful frown came on the sick
man’s face.</p>

<p>“Who can they be? Not Roger, certainly, for
it is but two days since he was here, and he had
but one man with him. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;” Then as
a thought struck him he broke off and cried excitedly,
“I say, Joe, does one of the men look at all
like a prisoner?”</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>

<p>“That’s a pity,” commented his master. “I had
a wild hope that Roger might have overtaken the
man. Anyway we shall know who they are in a
few minutes, and patience is a virtue that I’ve
plenty of opportunity for practising just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Laboriously he rose from his couch and seated
himself near the fire. The effort brought on a fit
of coughing, which was still shaking him, when a
whipstock rapped upon the door. His servant
opened it, and a white man entered, and stood for
a moment watching Bracknell as he coughed and
groaned. Then suddenly an alert look came in
his face and for one instant into his eyes there came
a flicker of recognition. He waited until the
paroxysm had passed, then in a voice that had in
it a note of sympathy he spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>“You seem in a bad way, friend.”</p>

<p>The voice of a cultured man, as Bracknell instantly
noted, and as he wiped his eyes the sick man
looked sharply at the new-comer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “and so would you be if you’d
had your lungs frozen.”</p>

<p>“Is it as bad as that?” asked the other in a voice
that was still sympathetic.</p>

<p>“It is, and worse! I’ve got scurvy too. I
suppose you haven’t such a thing as a potato with
you?”</p>

<p>The stranger smiled. “As it happens I have.
I never travel without in winter, because, as you
seem to know, a raw potato is better than lime
juice for scurvy, and a sight handier to carry. I
shall be happy to oblige you.”</p>

<p>He went to the door of the cabin and called an
order to the men outside. A few moments later
an Indian entered bringing with him seven or eight
potatoes. Bracknell instantly seized one, and
taking out a clasp knife began to cut thin slices
of the tuber, and to eat regardless of everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
but the one fact that here was salvation from one
of the diseases which afflicted him. He chewed
methodically, without speaking, and Adrian Rayner,
for he was the arrival, watched him with
curious eyes, reflecting on the irony of the situation
which made the heir of an ancient estate glad to
eat raw potato; for though he himself remained
incognito, he had already recognized Dick Bracknell.</p>

<p>“I’d go slow if I were you,” he said warningly,
as having finished one tuber, the sick man stretched
his hand for another. “You had better not
overdo it. A little every day is better than a glut;
and, of course, my stock is limited.”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell laughed weakly. “You’re right,
of course. But if you knew what I suffer you’d
understand the impulse to stuff oneself! I’ll go
slow, as you advise, and perhaps I shall get quit of
one disease at any rate, though the other will get
rid of me as sure as a gun.”</p>

<p>“You think so?” asked Rayner, with an eager
interest which Bracknell failed to note.</p>

<p>“Sure of it! I’ve seen other men this way&mdash;and
there was always a funeral at the end of it;
though not always a burial service. Parsons are
scarce up here!”</p>

<p>“Have you been long in the country?” asked
Rayner carelessly.</p>

<p>Bracknell looked at him sharply, as if suspicious
of so simple a question, and then gave a short
laugh. “I’ve been here a year or two. And you?
You’re pretty new to the North, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Rayner laughed. “A regular tenderfoot. I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
been here before, but only for a short spell, and
this time I’m straight from England.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked Bracknell, and appraised the
stranger anew. “In the mining line, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Nothing half so profitable,” answered Rayner
smilingly. “I am merely representing a legal firm,
and have come out on a rather curious mission, one
with little profit in it in fact, and with even a possibility
of loss.”</p>

<p>“That’s poor business for a lawyer,” said Bracknell
encouragingly.</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed Rayner, “and it’s not only that,
but it is about the queerest business that I ever
struck.” He turned and addressed a remark to
one of his men who had entered the cabin, and then
resumed, “It is quite a romance in high life, and
very interesting. Would you like to hear the
story?”</p>

<p>“I was always fond of romance,” answered
Bracknell with a laugh, “and as up here we’ve no
penny dreadfuls, I shall be glad to have a slice of
the real thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s real enough,” answered Rayner, “and
it’s interesting, because it has a rich and young and
beautiful girl for the heroine.”</p>

<p>“Romance always must have!” commented
Bracknell. “Your story, I can see, is going on the
penny plain and twopenny coloured line!”</p>

<p>“Not quite. It has deviations and some original
features. This girl’s father was immensely
rich, and whilst he remained in this country looking
after his mining properties, he sent his daughter to
England to be educated. There she ran against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the heir of an old Westmorland family, and married
him secretly&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off as his host rose unexpectedly to his
feet. “What is the matter?” he asked innocently.
“Are you not feeling well?”</p>

<p>“Just a spasm,” growled Bracknell. “It will
pass in a minute. Get on with your tale.”</p>

<p>The other smiled a little to himself, and resumed
his narrative. “As I was saying, she married this
young gentleman secretly, and immediately after
the marriage separated from him for some reason,
and at the same time something else happened,
which compelled her husband to leave England and
to reside abroad.... Did you say something?”</p>

<p>“No! It’s only this confounded wheeze of
mine!”</p>

<p>“About the same time news reached England
that the girl’s father had died in an accident out
here, and as by the terms of his will the daughter
was to reside for three years in the home he had
built in the woods here, she returned to the Dominion
without having said anything about the marriage
to her uncle and guardian, the well-known
solicitor Sir Joseph Rayner, of whom you perhaps
have heard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard of him! Go on, man. Your
story is very interesting.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately Sir Joseph was not left in ignorance
of the marriage, for the girl’s husband wrote and
informed him of it. Sir Joseph was astonished;
but he kept the news to himself, because the
husband, though of good family, had done something
that was&mdash;er&mdash;scarcely creditable. He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
not even inform the girl of the information which
had reached him, hoping that time would solve
what appeared to be a difficult situation.”</p>

<p>“And hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Time may solve many things, but the
policy of <i>laissez-faire</i>, whilst sometimes a good
one, is not without its dangers! This happens to
be one of the cases where the dangers predominate,
and time has but brought a new complication.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Bracknell sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, the girl is thinking of marrying again.”</p>

<p>“God in heaven!” Dick Bracknell had staggered
to his feet. His eyes were burning and
there was a ghastly pallor on his haggard face.
He glared at the narrator as if he could slay him.
“Man, do you know what you are saying?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Rayner, with well-affected surprise.
“I am saying that in her inexperience this
girl-wife is thinking of contracting a flesh marriage,
one in which her heart is engaged, as it
appears not to have been in the first. Of course
she may not understand the law as it relates to
bigamy, or she may believe that her husband is
dead&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who is the man?” asked Bracknell, in a strangled
voice.</p>

<p>“The man? I do not understand. Do you
mean the husband?”</p>

<p>“No, the man whom she is thinking of marrying?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Well, that’s the curious part of the
whole business, for this new lover is the cousin of
her husband, one time a barrister, but now out here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in the Mounted Police. What did you say? A
strange story. Yes, it is that; but there is one
piquant detail that you have not yet heard, sir!”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is this, the husband, as I informed you,
is the heir to an old estate in Westmorland. He
had a younger brother who since the elder’s disappearance
had slipped into the position of heir&mdash;at
least people had come to look upon him as such,
it being fairly well known that the elder could not
return to claim the succession. This younger son
is dead&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dead!” The word came in a gasp from Dick
Bracknell’s lips, and immediately after he was
taken with a fit of coughing which lasted for some
little time, and left him exhausted with his face
hidden in his hands.</p>

<p>“Your cough is very bad, sir,” said Rayner with
affected sympathy. “Are you sure that you wish
me to continue the narrative?”</p>

<p>Bracknell lifted a tortured face, and in his deep-sunk
eyes there was a moisture that was more
than suspicious. “Yes,” he said hoarsely. “Go
on!”</p>

<p>“As you wish,” replied Rayner with affected
solicitude, and then continued, “As I was saying,
this younger son is dead&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How did he die?” interrupted Bracknell.</p>

<p>“Something went wrong with his gun when he
was out grouse shooting. It burst, I believe, anyhow
it killed him, and by his death, failing the succession
of the older son, the cousin becomes the
heir, and you have the rather unique situation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the cousin stepping into the shoes of the heir and
the husband at one and the same time. Quite a
little drama in its way, is it not?”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell’s reply to the question was an
inarticulate one, and afterwards for a little time he
stared into the fire with eyes that looked almost
ferocious. Then he asked abruptly, “How do you
know all this?”</p>

<p>“As I explained, I am the representative of the
firm of Sir Joseph Rayner and Son, and I have been
sent out to find the girl wife&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To find J&mdash;er&mdash;the girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes! she left England very suddenly a few
weeks ago without informing Sir Joseph. She, as
we have ascertained, came to the Dominion, and
my principal suspecting that she was going to
marry the man I have mentioned, sent me to intervene.
Two courses are open for me to follow,
either to find the young lady, and explain to the
former that in the absence of proof of her husband’s
death such a marriage is of more than
doubtful legality; or to find the policeman and
point out that the young lady is already a wife.”</p>

<p>“But he&mdash;but what if he already knows?”</p>

<p>“Then in that case I shall be called upon to explain
the law to him also! But so far I have
accomplished none of these things. The policeman,
as I learned at Regina, is missing; and when
I arrived there the young lady had already left her
home up here for an unknown destination....
I do not know, of course, but I have my suspicions
as to who may be awaiting her at that destination.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, sir, you appear to be a man of education,
and you will remember that the great Antony
thought the world well lost for love, and what
Cleopatra thought, her actions proved. Human
nature does not change, and love is the strongest
passion it knows, and I suspect that her lover being
missing, the young lady has gone to look for him,
or if not that to meet him at some appointed rendezvous.
The two are young, between them they
will be fabulously rich and they will not be the first
pair of lovers to set the world and the world’s
conventions at defiance. At least they will be able
to afford it!”</p>

<p>“Never! by&mdash;&mdash; never!”</p>

<p>The words came from the sick man’s lips explosively.
He rose from his seat, and gripped Rayner’s
shoulder in a way that made him grimace with
pain.</p>

<p>“Man,” he cried, “are you telling me the
truth?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir! Why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>Bracknell’s eyes, full of wild light, glared down
into Rayner’s but the latter, as he lied, met them
unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“I do not, sir! We have not exchanged&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My name is Bracknell&mdash;Dick Bracknell; and I
can guess it is my wife and my cousin of whom you
have been talking. By&mdash;&mdash; if I had him here. And
to think that two days ago he was here, and that I
let him go.”</p>

<p>“He was here two days ago?”</p>

<p>“Two days ago&mdash;and I let him go because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
pitched a cock and bull story which I believed!
And I might have known all the time that it was so
much bunkum, just a yarn to get out of my hands.
I ought to have killed him as he tried to kill me by
poisoning my dogs. I remember now that once
before when we met, he showed a tenderness for
Joy that was more than natural in a mere cousin by
marriage. He suggested to me that I should
make reparations to my wife by allowing her to
divorce me!”</p>

<p>“That was a very crafty suggestion on his part!”
broke in Rayner suavely. “It would have cleared
his own way to your wife!”</p>

<p>The sick man was stung to madness at the
thought. His eyes burned and his face grew convulsed.
“Reparation!” he cried hoarsely in jealous
rage. “Reparation! The viper! If ever I
put eyes on him again, I will&mdash;&mdash;” he broke off as a
fit of coughing took him, and when it was over he
dropped to his seat utterly exhausted, gasping painfully
for breath.</p>

<p>The man whose lying story had brought on this
attack, watched him unmoved, and calculated cynically
whether Bracknell’s own estimate of the
span of life remaining to him was correct; then he
said, “I am very sorry for you, Mr. Bracknell, but
I cannot allow private wrongs to interfere with my
own mission. You say that your cousin was here
two days ago; perhaps you can tell me which way
he was travelling?”</p>

<p>“He was going up the river&mdash;to meet Joy as like
as not!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall follow! Perhaps I shall meet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
lady; if so, I shall be able to assure her that the
marriage she is contemplating is quite out of the
question.”</p>

<p>“Say nothing to the man about my threats, if you
find him,” said Bracknell, rousing himself. “Say
I’ve news for him, that I want to see him; as by&mdash;&mdash; I
do! Tell him what you like, but get him to
come back here.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best, sir!”</p>

<p>“If I’d dogs, sick though I am, I’d follow him
myself. But that’s out of the question. I shall
rely on you to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You may, sir,” broke in Rayner obsequiously.
“If I find him, I will certainly induce him to come
back to you, if I can. But I hope you will not be
violent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Violent! Bring him here,” Bracknell laughed
almost deliriously, “and you will see.”</p>

<p class="pc ls3">.......</p>

<p>In the morning when Adrian Rayner took the
trail, he looked back at the haggard man standing
by the cabin door. Bracknell had been delirious
in the night, and now as he stood there swaying,
the other looked at him without pity.</p>

<p>“Booked!” he muttered to himself, “and knows
it. If Roger Bracknell should happen to return
here, Harrow Fell will require a new heir, and I
shall be saved from a disagreeable necessity. But
that chance is not to be depended on. I must find
him if I can.”</p>

<p>And as he followed the Northward trail there
was the index of grim purpose in his face.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">HUSBAND AND WIFE</p>

<p class="drop-cap05"><span class="beg">IT WAS THE</span> end of the day, and Joy Gargrave,
kneeling down on a litter of young spruce
boughs, in the shadow of a wind screen,
stretched her mittened hands towards the fire.
Then she removed her face mask and looked at her
foster-sister, who having changed her moccasins
was placing the pair she had worn through the day
near the fire where they would dry slowly.</p>

<p>“Tired, Babette?”</p>

<p>“Not more than ordinary,” was the reply,
“though I will own to having found those last two
miles against the wind a little trying.”</p>

<p>They had been travelling for a week, and were
growing used to the evil of the trail. Body stiffness
no longer troubled them, and having been inured
to the task from childhood, the agony of cramp
brought on by snow-shoe work was unknown to
them, the hard exercise of the trail inducing no
more than a healthy tiredness at the end of the
day. Joy stretched herself luxuriously on the
spruce, and looked round. The darkness of the
woods was behind them, and in front the waste of
snow showed dimly. In the circle of firelight the
Indian George was preparing the evening meal,
whilst his son Jim was feeding the dogs. The girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
watched them meditatively for a moment or two,
then she spoke to Miss La Farge&mdash;</p>

<p>“A little different to the Ritz, Babette!”</p>

<p>Babette looked up from the steaming moccasins.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Joy?”</p>

<p>Joy waved her hand in a half circle. “Why,
everything&mdash;the trees, the snow, the darkness, the
dogs, the camp-fire, George and Jim, and you and I
like a couple of Dianas.”</p>

<p>Babette laughed and looked round appreciatively.
“It makes me think of a picture which I
saw when we were in London. It had a fancy
name&mdash;’When the World was Young,’ or something
like that&mdash;and whoever painted it knew the
wilderness well. It is, as you say, a little different
to the Ritz&mdash;and ever so much better. I wonder
how long we shall be on trail, not that I’m tired of
it. Even hard work has its pleasures and compensations.”</p>

<p>“I do not know how long we shall be. I am content
that we are on the right trail. The strange
Indian with whom George talked today told a
story of a white man, an officer of police, who had
been taken to the winter camp of his tribe with a
broken leg. The leg had healed, and the officer
had departed ten days ago on the trail of a bad
white man, and he went Northward. From the
description given the officer was almost certainly
Corporal Bracknell, and I have an idea that he may
have news of Dick Bracknell and be following his
trail, in which case I pray that we may come up with
him soon; for if there was trouble between them,
and the Corporal killed his cousin, it would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
very terrible thing, in view of the situation as regards
the succession to Harrow Fell.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Miss La Farge slowly, “but it
is no use shutting one’s eyes to facts. The death
of Dick Bracknell would be a relief to many people&mdash;yourself
included!”</p>

<p>“It would be no relief to me if Dick Bracknell
died by his cousin’s hand,” answered Joy in a low
voice. “It would be quite terrible; it is more than
I dare contemplate.”</p>

<p>“Why?” As Babette La Farge shot the question
at her foster-sister she looked at her keenly,
and saw a wave of warm blood surge over the beautiful
face, and as she saw it her own grew suddenly
tender. “No,” she added hurriedly, “don’t answer
the question, Joy. There is no need. I can
guess the answer, which I am sure you would not
give me. I think you are right&mdash;for everybody’s
sake nothing must happen between those two men.
At all costs that must be prevented.”</p>

<p>She dropped the moccasins, took a couple of
steps forward, and stopping, kissed Joy’s warm
cheek. “My dear,” she said, “you must not
worry. Time will unravel this dreadful tangle,
and after all you are young yet.”</p>

<p>Joy looked up at her trying bravely to smile, but
there was the gleam of unshed tears in her eyes.
She was about to speak, when the servant George
announced that supper was ready, and she contented
herself with a glance that was full of love
and gratitude.</p>

<p>The next morning, just before they broke camp
the younger Indian, who had been out inspecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the trail, returned with news. He had been a
little way up the river and had encountered a
strange Indian in the act of taking a marten from a
trap. He had talked with this man, and when the
latter had heard who his mistress was he had betrayed
considerable excitement, and had asked him
to wait for him a little time, as he might have a
message for his mistress. He had gone away, and
a little later had returned and had then told Jim
that his master&mdash;a white man&mdash;was lying sick in a
cabin on a creek a little way up the river, and that
he earnestly desired that Miss Gargrave would go
and speak with him.</p>

<p>“Did he give his master’s name?” asked Joy, as
a quick hope awoke within her.</p>

<p>“No, Miss, but he hav’ yours; he say you know
him. And I wonder if he is the man we seek.”</p>

<p>Joy also wondered, wondered and hoped, and
after consideration she nodded her head. “Yes, I
will go and see this man. He may be Corporal
Bracknell, or he may have seen him recently. In
any case it is a Christian charity to visit any
stricken white man in this desolate bush, and it will
mean only a short delay. Where is the creek,
Jim?”</p>

<p>“Up the river a little way, miss. The man he
waits at the point where it joins the river.”</p>

<p>“Then Miss La Farge and I will go on ahead,
and you can come on behind, and if you do not
overtake us, you can await us at the mouth of the
creek.”</p>

<p>The two girls started off, and presently reached
the creek, where stamping his feet in the snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Dick Bracknell’s man, Joe, awaited them. Both
of them glanced at him keenly, but he was a
stranger to them, and then Joy addressed him.</p>

<p>“Your master, where is he?”</p>

<p>The Indian pointed up the creek. “Him sick
man, I take you to him!”</p>

<p>Without waiting for further words the man
turned in his tracks and swung up the creek at such
a pace that the two girls had hard work to keep up
with him. Joy questioned the man as to his master’s
name, but the man either did not or would not
understand, for he merely shook his head, and
pressed forward. In a few minutes they reached
the little cabin at the edge of the trees, and maintaining
a wooden face, the Indian swung the door
open and motioned them to enter.</p>

<p>Joy pressed forward eagerly with her foster-sister
at her heels. The Indian softly closed the
door behind them, an evil smile wrinkling his
scarred face, then going to the rear of the hut, a
moment later he appeared with a bow and some
arrows in his hand, and entering the shadow of the
trees, he began to walk towards the mouth of the
creek.</p>

<p class="pn">... As she entered the cabin Joy Gargrave
looked quickly about her. The only light came
through a parchment window and from the improvised
stove, and in the semi-darkness, at first, she
could see nothing. But after a moment she discerned
a tall figure standing but a little way from
her. The face was in shadow, and she could not
make out the features, but as her eyes fell on him,
the man gave vent to a thin, choking laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good morning, my dear Joy! This is an unexpected
pleasure!”</p>

<p>At the sound of the voice Joy started, and with
a dawning fear in her eyes leaned forward and
stared into the haggard face before her. As she
did so, her fear increased, and she asked suddenly,
“Who are you, that you should address me in that
way?”</p>

<p>“Then you do not recognize me?” asked the
voice mockingly. “I am not surprised. Time has
wrought inevitable changes&mdash;but of course, it does
not change the constant heart. Look again, my
dear, and you will see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Overwhelming fear surged in the girl’s heart.
She knew who this haggard man was; indeed, she
had known from the first word that he had spoken,
and now she turned abruptly towards the door as if
to flee. The door was closed, and as she stretched
a hand towards the wooden latch, the thin cackling
laugh broke out again.</p>

<p>“The door is fastened, my dear Joy&mdash;on the
outside. I remember how you ran from me at
Alcombe, and when I arranged this joyous meeting,
I foresaw that you might be startled, that you
might try to repeat that old folly; therefore I
took steps&mdash;and my man Joe keeps the door outside.
But I am glad to see you, dear wife, most
unfeignedly glad to see you, and there is no need
that you should hurry away; indeed, I am afraid
that until I give permission for you to go, you will
have to remain here.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked Joy, striving in
vain to keep her voice steady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do I want?” there was an accent of mock
surprise in Dick Bracknell’s voice as he echoed the
question, and then he laughed again in a way that
made the girl shiver. “What a question to ask a
husband who has not seen his wife since his marriage
morning! Really, my dear, such a question
ought to be quite unnecessary.”</p>

<p>He broke off as his cough took him, and for
perhaps half a minute he was shaken by it, and
could not speak. When he resumed it was in a
different tone.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said, “I want to talk to you,
and there is no need that you stand on ceremony
in your husband’s house. I regret the scarcity of
chairs, but there is a log by the fire there&mdash;and if
you will accept the advice of an expert you will
throw off your furs.... You won’t? Well, self-will
is one of the characteristics of your sex, and no
doubt you will please yourself. But all the same
allow me to express my gratitude to you that you
should have left your home in mid-winter to come
and look for me. Such solicitude is beyond what I
had ex&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I was not looking for you,” Joy broke in.
“You are the last person I was expecting to meet!”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” The mockery had gone out of
Bracknell’s voice now, and there was a dangerous
ring in it. The eyes in the haggard face were blazing,
and to both the girls it was clear that he had
much ado to keep himself in hand. “You dare to
tell me that&mdash;me, your lawful husband? Perhaps
you will tell me for whom you did leave your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
home then? Whom you were following and seeking
on a winter trail?”</p>

<p>Joy felt her face flush suddenly. Could she tell
him? she asked herself, and immediately her mind
answered “No!” In the wild mood that was on
him Dick Bracknell would be sure to put a false
interpretation on any explanation that she might
offer him. Realizing this she was silent, and a
moment later he broke out again, wrathfully&mdash;</p>

<p>“You won’t tell me? You’re ashamed to tell
me, I suppose. But accept my assurances that
there is no need. I already know. My cousin
Roger is the favoured man, is he not? You start
at that! Then it is all true what I have heard,
that not only is he to supplant me at Harrow Fell,
but in my wife’s affections also? Well, that is not
going to happen. I will have Harrow Fell and
you also&mdash;and you first, my Joy, for there shall
be no cuckoo in my nest.... Yes, I will have
Harrow Fell. I can face five years at Portland or
at Parkhurst for that. But first, I will have you.
You are here, in your husband’s house, where you
have come of your own accord, and here you remain.
Take off your furs!”</p>

<p>To Joy it was clear that Dick Bracknell was almost
insanely jealous, and her face blanched as the
possibilities of the situation flashed themselves
upon her. The man took a step forward as if to
enforce his order, and she shrank back against the
rough logs of the shack. Bracknell laughed savagely,
but the next moment there came an intervention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stand back, Mr. Bracknell!”</p>

<p>The speaker was Miss La Farge, and as she
stepped resolutely forward, holding a small but
serviceable looking machine pistol in her hand,
Dick Bracknell came to a standstill.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do as I tell you. Lay a finger on Joy, and I
will shoot you. She may be your wife, but she is
my more-than-sister, and I will brook no violence
from you.”</p>

<p>Bracknell looked at her irresolutely. It was very
clear to him that she would keep her word, and
after a moment he stepped back and laughed to
cover his discomfiture.</p>

<p>“A she-lynx&mdash;and with claws! Well, time is on
my side. You will grow tired of standing there,
and Joe will be back in a minute or two, then I
shall know how to deal with you.”</p>

<p>Babette did not even reply to him. She glanced
at the door and addressed herself to Joy.</p>

<p>“Try and open the door, Joy.”</p>

<p>Joy sprang to the door, and lifting the wooden
latch tugged hard at the door. Dick Bracknell
watched her with amused eyes, and when all her
efforts failed, he spoke again.</p>

<p>“It is no use, my dear Joy. The door is fastened
on the outside. We are all prisoners until
Joe returns.”</p>

<p>“No!” replied Miss La Farge stubbornly. “Not
until then. Our men will be here in a few
minutes if we do not meet them at the mouth of
the creek. Then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A sharp cry of agony sounded somewhere outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and as it reached them, the girl’s speech suddenly
froze.</p>

<p>“What was that?” asked Joy, looking at
Bracknell.</p>

<p>A deep frown had come upon his face, and there
was apprehension in his voice as he replied, “I&mdash;I
do not know. Some one may have been hurt.
I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was still speaking, haltingly, when the crash
of a rifle broke on his words, followed by a shout,
and that in turn by a great stillness. The three
people in the shack looked at one another helplessly.</p>

<p>The girls’ faces were white, and Bracknell’s features
showed wrathful. In silence they waited
and nothing further happened. Half an hour
passed, during which the girls whispered to each
other, and still the silence outside was maintained,
and to those in the cabin it seemed to hold a menace
of mysterious things. Another half hour crept
by, and then Bracknell spoke hoarsely&mdash;</p>

<p>“Something must have happened, or the Indian
would have been back before this. And your men&mdash;you
said they were to meet you at the mouth of
the creek!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Joy composedly. “And no
doubt they are waiting there now.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” answered her husband.
“Something has occurred&mdash;what, we must find
out!” He glanced at the window of skin parchment,
then added, “That is the only way. We
must cut that out. One of us must climb through
and open the door&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Joy shall go!” said Miss La Farge firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter who goes! This is a business
of life and death. There is an axe in the corner
there. If one of you will use it, I shall be
obliged. I am afraid that the state of my lungs
does not permit much exertion on my part.”</p>

<p>Babette looked at Joy, who, finding the ax,
attacked the window, and a moment later the
freezing air drove into the cabin. When the
rough frame was quite clear the man nodded at
her. His manner was now very quiet and betrayed
nothing of the jealous rage which had possessed him
an hour ago.</p>

<p>“Go through, Joy. Take the axe with you.
You may need it to knock out the staple. Have
no fear,” he said as she visibly hesitated. “I give
you my word that this is no trap. Believe me, I
am very anxious for the safety of all of us.”</p>

<p>Joy glanced once at him. It was plain to her
that he was sincere, and two seconds later she
climbed to the window and dropped down into the
snow. A minute later the door swung open, and
she was joined by Babette and Dick Bracknell. All
three stood there looking down the creek. No
sound reached them. Everywhere was the appalling
inscrutable silence of the Northern wilderness.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pch">DICK BRACKNELL LEARNS THE TRUTH</p>

<p class="drop-cap03"><span class="beg">“WE MUST</span> find out what has happened!”
said Joy, looking at Bracknell.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said slowly, “but you must
not go alone. If you will wait a moment I will
accompany you.”</p>

<p>“But your cough&mdash;&mdash;” Joy began, a tone of
solicitude in her voice.</p>

<p>“My cough!” Dick Bracknell laughed bitterly.
“That is nothing to what may lie before us, and
in any case it is not safe for you to go alone.”</p>

<p>Something in his voice and manner convinced
her that he was not speaking idly, and that he had
his own reasons for apprehension.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said, “we will wait for you.
We will go down the creek together.”</p>

<p>He turned back into the hut, and the two girls
looked at each other. They were used to the stillness
of the forest, but somehow the silence that
prevailed seemed ominous of fateful things. Both
of them were conscious of vague forebodings, and
as Babette looked at her foster-sister, and saw the
light of apprehension in her eyes, she whispered,
“What do you think, Joy? What do you think has
happened?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, but I feel that it is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
dreadful and I am afraid.” She looked towards
the cabin, and added, “He is afraid also. You can
see that!”</p>

<p>“Yes! That is very clear.”</p>

<p>They stood waiting until Dick Bracknell appeared,
and then without speaking all three started
down the creek. A few minutes walking brought
them in sight of the main trail, and suddenly Joy
gave a cry, and pointed ahead. The figure of a
man was lying prone in the snow, and as he caught
sight of it, Dick Bracknell broke into a feeble run.
For a moment the two girls stood quite still, looking
each at the blanched face of the other, then they
followed, slowly, the premonition of tragedy mounting
in their hearts.</p>

<p>When they reached Bracknell they found him
stooping over the figure, with a look of consternation
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you know him? Is it your&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Babette. “It is George!”</p>

<p>“George! Who is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He was my father’s man, and he is mine!”
said Joy, staring at the fallen Indian with stricken
eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” said Dick Bracknell quietly, “he is yours
no longer! He has gone to the happy hunting
grounds.”</p>

<p>“Dead?” cried Joy, as the truth broke upon her.
“George dead! But how? What&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bracknell looked up at her, moved by the
anguish in her tones, then he pointed to what she
had not seen, a feathered arrow head, half hidden
by the crook of the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” she sobbed. “He has been killed.
He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But where is Jim? Where are the dogs?”
cried her foster-sister. “Both have been here!
See, here are the tracks, and there goes the trail
northward!”</p>

<p>It was as she said, and as Dick Bracknell looked
down and read the signs a dark look came on his
face. Babette looked from her foster-sister, sobbing
in the snow, to the man who was her husband.</p>

<p>“What do you think has happened?” she asked.</p>

<p>He looked from her to Joy commiseratingly. “I
can only guess,” he said in a troubled voice. “I
think the Indian who was with me is responsible for
this, the man who brought you to my shack&mdash;you
know. When you came to the cabin he had instructions
to look out for your men at the mouth of the
creek. I&mdash;I am afraid he exceeded my instructions.
I think that he must have attacked your men&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But why should he do that, if you did not tell
him?”</p>

<p>As Joy flung this question at him, a troubled look
came upon his face.</p>

<p>“I think he wanted your dogs and outfit, that we
might get away from here!”</p>

<p>“Our dogs and outfit?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He is devoted to me, but twice lately I
have had trouble on that point. Once when my
cousin Roger Bracknell came&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly as Joy sprang to her feet.
“Your cousin Roger has been here?” she cried.
“He is alive then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>As she flung her questions at him eagerly, impetuously,
the man’s face clouded, and again a jealous
light came in his eyes. It was a moment before he
answered the questions, and to Babette, watching
him it appeared that he was struggling hard for
self-mastery.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, at last, in a hoarse voice.
“He is alive! He came to my cabin by accident.
He had broken his leg, and had lain in an Indian
encampment for weeks. There he had heard news
which had sent him hot foot on the trail of a man
who was responsible for your father’s death!”</p>

<p>“For my father’s death?” as she cried the words
Joy’s face was white as the snow about her. “But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her voice faltered, and guessing what she would
have said, Bracknell explained. “I am afraid it
will come as a shock to you even after these three
or four years, but it appears to be the fact that
your father’s death was not altogether accidental.</p>

<p>“My cousin had a very circumstantial story of the
affair, and he was on the trail of the man who
was responsible for the crime, the same man, as he
believes, who shot me on the night when I had
arranged that meeting with you at North Star.”</p>

<p>“But who is the man?” asked Joy quickly.</p>

<p>“My cousin gave me no name, indeed he declined
to do so. But he had his theory, and he went so
far as to tell me that not only did the Indian who
was with him know the man, but that he himself
believed that he knew him.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Her husband looked at her. “You also guess?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” she answered. “I guess&mdash;but no more
than guess!”</p>

<p>“Who is the man?” asked Bracknell quickly.</p>

<p>“His name is Adrian Rayner!”</p>

<p>“Rayner!” cried Bracknell excitedly. “The son
of old Rayner, your guardian?”</p>

<p>“Yes! He is in the North now. I believe
that he is looking for Roger Bracknell.”</p>

<p>“God in heaven!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Joy. “You look
as if something had occurred to you!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” he said simply. “Something has&mdash;something
very significant. Two or three days
after Roger left the shack a stranger arrived&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bracknell,” interrupted Miss La Farge,
“don’t you think we had better postpone explanations
for a little time? If we remain talking here
we shall freeze. And there are things to be done.
There is Jim to find&mdash;and there is the team and the
outfit. Then we must bury George. We can’t
possibly leave him lying here for the wolves!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bracknell. “I was forgetting.”
He considered a moment and then spoke again.
“The sled tracks run up the river. If you two were
to follow a little way, till you get to that spur there,
you will have a long view of the trail, and possibly
you will be able to see something of the team and
your man. But don’t go too far. It won’t be safe.
Whilst you are away, I will arrange tree-burial for
this poor fellow. And when you return we can
discuss the situation. Do you agree?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Joy.</p>

<p>“Then I will waste no time, nor, I hope, will
you.”</p>

<p>He turned and began to walk up the creek in a
way that revealed what an effort it was for him,
and for a second or two Joy watched him with
pitying eyes, then as her foster-sister spoke, she
turned, and without answering began to follow the
sled tracks.</p>

<p>After they had trudged a little way, Babette
spoke.</p>

<p>“Dick Bracknell is a strange man. Two hours
ago he was within an ace of violence towards you,
and now I believe he is really solicitous for your
welfare.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Joy. “He is full of contradictions.
There are many men like him, I suppose.
When he is good he is very good, and when he is
bad he is almost satanic. When I first met him he
was a gentleman, an attractive one; and but for
unfortunate influences he might have continued&mdash;but
now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now he is a wreck, physical and moral,” answered
Babette, and then asked sharply, “Suppose
we do not find Jim and the dogs, Joy?”</p>

<p>“We must find them!”</p>

<p>“But suppose we do not? What then?”</p>

<p>“Then we shall have to take refuge in the cabin.”</p>

<p>She said no more, and Babette asked no more
questions. In half an hour they reached the wooded
spur round which the river turned, and as they
reached the further side, both came to a standstill
and looked at the frozen waste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>For two or three miles the course of the river was
visible between low, wooded banks. Snow was
everywhere, and nowhere was the white surface
broken by any moving figure. It was a land of
death&mdash;death white and cold. Babette shivered as
she looked on it.</p>

<p>“They are not here, Joy,” she whispered.
“Neither Jim nor the dogs.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Joy stonily.</p>

<p>“We shall have to go back to the cabin to&mdash;to&mdash;your
husband.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is no other way!” A sob broke from
her, then she bit her lip, and added, “It is a
strange irony that now my safety should depend on
him.”</p>

<p>“Dare you trust him&mdash;Joy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Joy thoughtfully. “I can trust
him&mdash;now. As you have seen he is a very sick
man, and in spite of the way in which he raved
in the cabin, I believe that now he is greatly concerned
for my safety, and yours. Did you notice
the sudden change in his attitude after I had mentioned
Adrian Rayner’s name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was startled. His manner completely
altered. Something struck him with your mention
of the name. I wonder what it was?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I cannot even guess, but no
doubt we shall hear presently. There is nothing
for us to do but to return to the cabin.”</p>

<p>Her foster-sister nodded thoughtfully. “Yes,
we shall have to do that. We can do nothing else.”
She paused a moment and then asked, “You don’t
think George’s son has deserted us, Joy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“No!” answered Joy emphatically. “Something
has driven him away. But he will return&mdash;if he
can. I am sure of that!”</p>

<p>They turned in their tracks and slowly retraced
their way to the cabin. Dick Bracknell was standing
at the door, evidently waiting for them, and as
they approached he flashed a look of inquiry at Joy.
She shook her head.</p>

<p>“No,” she said quietly. “There is nothing to be
seen anywhere.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” answered Bracknell simply. “You
must wait here. Perhaps your other man will
return, or if he does not my man may.”</p>

<p>He opened the door and held it for them to pass
in.</p>

<p>“You can take off your furs,” he said, as they
entered. “I have blocked the window with snow,
and stretched a blanket over it. I am afraid that
it will be rather dark, but that is unavoidable.”</p>

<p>The two girls followed his suggestion and seated
themselves by the stove. For a little time no one
spoke, and the red glow of the fire shining on their
faces showed them very thoughtful. At last, Joy
broke the silence.</p>

<p>“You were saying that two or three days after
your cousin left here a stranger arrived. Who was
it? Do you know?”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell laughed mirthlessly. “I do not
know for certain. I can only guess.”</p>

<p>“And you guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That it was old Rayner’s son&mdash;Adrian, I think
you called him. Of course he didn’t tell me who
he was, but he let out that he was looking for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Cousin Roger, and posed as a lawyer’s clerk. I’m
morally certain, however, that he was young
Rayner!”</p>

<p>Joy remembered his sudden change of manner
when she had said that Adrian Rayner was in the
North, looking, as she believed for Roger Bracknell,
and after a moment, urged by something deeper
than curiosity, she spoke, “You hinted that something
very significant had occurred to you. What
was it?”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell hesitated, and it was evident that
he was wondering whether to tell her or not. Then
he laughed bitterly. “You may as well know all
the kinds of fool I am. This stranger pitched a
yarn about you and Roger, and I was fool enough
to believe him.”</p>

<p>He broke off and looked at Joy, whose face was
flaming. Even in the red glow of the firelight the
flush revealed itself to him, but though he frowned
a little, he continued in an even voice. “He told
me that my brother Geoffrey was dead, and that
as I was either dead or as good as dead, Roger
quite naturally was reckoned as the heir to Harrow
Fell. He said further that you knew of this and
that you were looking for Roger with the news and
with the intention of marrying him.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>As the exclamation broke from her, Joy abruptly
hid her face in her hands, Bracknell coughed a
little and then resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>“He claimed to be the agent of old Rayner, and
declared he was looking for Roger Bracknell in
order to warn him of your previous marriage, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to give him warning that I was alive, in case you&mdash;a&mdash;should
not regard that marriage as binding.”</p>

<p>He looked at Joy again. Her face was still hidden
in her hands.</p>

<p>“As I said, I was fool enough to believe him, and
that accounts for my amiable reception of you just
now. It even accounts for your presence here, for
when my man Joe brought news that you were out
in the Northward trail, the trail that Roger was
following, I was morally certain that you were out
upon his track, and I set out to trap you. You
must own that your unexpected presence did give
colour to Rayner’s story, and that I had some excuse
for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I <i>was</i> looking for your cousin Roger,” interrupted
Joy, suddenly lifting her face, and meeting his
questioning gaze.</p>

<p>He looked at her but did not immediately reply.
And in the silence that followed Miss La Farge rose
from her seat and began to put on her furs.</p>

<p>“I am going outside,” she said. “It is better
that I should. You two have things to say to each
other that should only be said between you.”</p>

<p>She passed out, shutting the door behind her,
and after a little time, Dick Bracknell spoke again.</p>

<p>“You say you were looking for my Cousin Roger?
That is a very damaging admission, is it not? It
would seem that, after all, that fellow Rayner was
not far off the mark.”</p>

<p>“You do not believe that?” answered Joy, meeting
his gaze with steady eyes.</p>

<p>He laughed shortly. “No,” he admitted. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
do not believe it&mdash;now, but I will own that I am
a little curious as to the reason why you should
follow on my cousin’s trail. It is&mdash;er&mdash;a little
unusual.”</p>

<p>“I was following him, as I believed, to save him.
Adrian Rayner wanted to marry me, and I had
accused him of trying to kill you at North Star.
He knew all about my marriage to you, though how
he got the knowledge I cannot tell&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is simple enough!” broke in her husband.
“I wrote to old Rayner and told him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But my uncle did not know, I am sure he did
not know. He himself wanted me to marry Adrian,
and I can’t believe he knew.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” admitted Bracknell thoughtfully.
“It is possible that young Rayner got hold of my
letter to his father and that the old man never
saw it at all. But what has this to do with my
cousin!”</p>

<p>“This! Adrian Rayner told me that he was
coming here in order to prove that you were dead
but I was morally certain that he was coming here
to find your cousin Roger and to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“To shoot him, hey? Why should he want to
do that?”</p>

<p>“Because he knew that your cousin suspected
him of that attempt on your life at North Star!”</p>

<p>“Wanted to get rid of a witness, I suppose. And
you were following Roger to warn him.”</p>

<p>“Yes! That was one reason.”</p>

<p>“Um! It’s a nice coil, for sure. I entertain the
man who tried to murder me, and I set him on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
trail of my cousin who was trying to bring him to
justice. That is about as pretty a kettle of fish
as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you did not tell Adrian Rayner where
Roger had gone?” cried Joy, springing to her feet.
“Surely you did not tell him?”</p>

<p>“At that time,” answered Bracknell slowly, “it
seemed to me that I had little cause to love my
Cousin Roger. You are to remember that I was
in ignorance of much that I have learned this
morning.”</p>

<p>“You told him?” cried Joy.</p>

<p>“I certainly put him on the track,” answered the
man.</p>

<p>“Then God forgive you! God forgive you!”
cried Joy in anguished tones.</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell’s face set hard, and only by an
effort was he able to control himself. But after a
moment he replied quietly, “As I have said, I
did not know Rayner. I had no inkling of his
game.”</p>

<p>“No!” said Joy stonily. “I understand that.”</p>

<p>“You hinted that there was another reason,”
said Bracknell, watching her closely. “I wonder if
you would mind telling me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind at all,” broke in Joy impulsively.
“Your brother Geoffrey was killed whilst
I was in England. Indeed, I was the one to find
him dead. No one knew whether you were alive
or dead, even I did not know, and Roger was regarded
as the heir. But I knew that when he left
North Star that he was going to try and learn what
had really happened to you, and I was afraid that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
there was a collision between you, and anything
dreadful happened, people might say that he&mdash;that
he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She broke off, and hesitated.</p>

<p>“I understand,” said her husband. “You need
not say it. I dare say you are quite right. This
world is full of Christian charity.”</p>

<p>“I cabled him and tried to get in touch with
him. I learned that he was missing. I came out,
and at Regina I discovered that nothing whatever
had been heard about him, but I discovered also
that Adrian Rayner had been making inquiries,
that he was on his trail. Then I was certain of
his evil purpose, and when I reached North Star
and found Adrian there, I accused him, for I was
very sure of his intentions. As soon as I could I
started to look for your cousin myself&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You seem very anxious about my cousin,” broke
in her husband quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh, how can I help being?” cried Joy.</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell took a step forward, and put a
hand on her shoulder. She did not shrink, and as
his eyes searched her face, she met his gaze steadily.
They stood there silent for what seemed a long time,
then Bracknell dropped his hand.</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” he said wearily, “and I
do not blame you. And I am sure that both
Roger and you have played the game! Well, I’m
crocked, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off and laughed harshly. Then his
haggard face grew suddenly convulsed with rage.
“That&mdash;Rayner! If only I could meet him
again I think I could die happily!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Joy looked at him, her heart wrung with pity
for him. She stretched a hand impulsively, and
was about to speak when the door was flung open
violently, and Miss La Farge rushed in, hastily
barring the door behind her.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pch">UNDER COVER OF NIGHT</p>


<p class="drop-cap07"><span class="beg">SHE STOOD</span> there gasping for breath, and unable
to speak; and to both the others in the
cabin it was evident that something startling
had occurred. Dick Bracknell found his
tongue first.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Miss La Farge? What has
happened?”</p>

<p>Babette found her breath and cried pantingly,</p>

<p>“Some one tried to kill me?”</p>

<p>“To kill you!” her listeners cried together incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes. I was walking down the creek, wondering
where Jim and our dogs were gone to, when I
heard a sharp sound, just like the twang of a bowstring
and looked round. I could see nothing, and
the woods on the banks were quite still and silent,
nothing moving anywhere. I was still looking,
and convincing myself that I had imagined the
sound when it occurred again, and a second later
an arrow struck a tree close by me, and remained
there, quivering. I did not remain to see any more,
or to try and learn who had sent it. I turned in my
tracks and ran back here, and once as I ran an
arrow passed clean through my parka, and buried
itself in the snow beyond.”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell broke out, suddenly, “Confound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
it,” he cried, “this is intolerable. That Indian Joe
must have gone mad!”</p>

<p>“You think it is your man?” asked Joy quickly.</p>

<p>“I am sure of it! Who else can it be in this
God-forsaken wilderness? It must be he, but I will
soon find out!”</p>

<p>He moved towards the door and throwing down
the bar, opened it. There was nothing visible but
the snow, and the dark woods. He took a step
forward, and as he did so something came swishing
through the air and struck the door post. He knew
what it was before he saw it, and cried out.</p>

<p>“Joe, you confounded fool, what&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The sharp crack of a rifle broke in on the words,
and a bullet cut the fur off his coat at the top of
the shoulder. He turned quickly round, and
tumbled backward into the cabin, kicking the door
to behind him. Joy ran forward, and dropped the
bar in place, then looked at him.</p>

<p>“You are hurt?” she cried anxiously.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, as he picked himself up.</p>

<p>“Only knocked over with surprise.”</p>

<p>“But that was a rifle, wasn’t it? Some one fired
at you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some one certainly did!” He gave a
wheezy laugh as he lifted a hand to his shoulder.</p>

<p>“And he almost got me. He made the fur fly,
and if it had struck an inch or two lower down I
should have been out of action for a while at any
rate. He must be a rotten shot, for out there on
the snow I must have been a perfect mark!”</p>

<p>“But what on earth can your man be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is not Joe,” broke in Bracknell with conviction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
“Even if he has gone clean into lunacy he’d
never do a thing like that to me. Besides, Joe had
no gun with him. Our guns are there in the corner,
and as we’ve run out of ammunition they are no use.
It simply can’t be Joe.”</p>

<p>“Then who can it be? And why should he want
to do a thing like that?”</p>

<p>“It may be your other man&mdash;Jim, didn’t you call
him? He may have returned, and thinking you
were prisoners here, may have tried to get me in
the hope of releasing you.”</p>

<p>“But you forget the attack on Babette! Some
one shot arrows at her and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By Jove! I had forgotten something! Stand
away from the door. I’m going to open it.
There’s something I want to get.”</p>

<p>“Oh, be careful!” cried Joy.</p>

<p>He swung around and looked at her whimsically,
then he said quietly, “I’ll be careful for your sake,
not my own. I’ve got to get you safely out of this.
That much I owe you at any rate.”</p>

<p>He turned again to the door and cautiously opening
it a little way, peeped out. There was nothing
visible, and quickly he opened the door wider and
thrusting out an arm, gripped the arrow which was
sticking in the post, and hastily flung the door in
place once more. Even as he did so, something
crashed into the wood, and the sound of a shot
reverberated through the stillness outside.</p>

<p>The two girls looked at him, their faces were
white and they were much alarmed. Bracknell
looked at the door and laughed shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“It seems that we are to stand a regular siege,”
he said. “That man of yours is of the persevering
sort.”</p>

<p>Neither Joy nor her foster-sister replied, and
moving towards the stove Bracknell threw on a
spruce log, and as it caught and flamed up he
stopped, and by its light he examined the arrow in
his hand. Quarter of a minute later he stood up.</p>

<p>“This settles it,” he said. “This arrow is not
Joe’s. It is too finely made, with an ivory barb
on which somebody has spent time. Joe’s bow and
arrows were makeshifts, and his barbs were of
moose bone!”</p>

<p>“Then who can it be?” asked Joy. “Jim would
have no arrows at all, and he certainly would not
have fired them at Babette if he had.”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell shook his head. “I cannot think.
It may be a roving band of Indians from the far
North. This arrow tells its own story. It is like
those made by the Indian Esquimaux in the North
Behring. I’ve been up there and I’ve seen arrows
like it before.”</p>

<p>“But at least one of our attackers has a rifle,”
said Miss La Farge.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bracknell thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“And why should they attack us at all?” asked
Joy.</p>

<p>“They may be out for plunder. Most of these
fellows have a weakness for the possessions of white
men. I’ve seen one of them risk his life for a woodman’s
axe, and they’ll give their heads for a sheath
knife. They will have seen the cabin and may think
that there are things worth having here, but in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
case they will find out the mistake in a very few
days.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because we haven’t more than two or three days’
stock of food,” replied Bracknell grimly. “There’s
only a small stock of coffee, a few beans and some
frozen moose meat. That’s why I suspected Joe of
trying to get your outfit. But I’ve changed my
mind now. I think that those fellows outside may
have killed your man&mdash;and Joe also, if we only
knew!”</p>

<p>“Then our position is rather desperate?”</p>

<p>Bracknell nodded. “If those beggars really mean
business, we’re in a pretty tight corner. They may
rush the cabin or they may wait. In either case
they will get us!”</p>

<p>“There is one possibility that you have not
thought of yet,” said Babette slowly.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“It is that this attack may not have been made by
any roving tribe at all.”</p>

<p>“But who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Adrian Rayner!”</p>

<p>“God in heaven!” as the exclamation broke from
his lips Dick Bracknell looked at her in amazed conviction.
“Of course, I never thought of him!”</p>

<p>“He is the one man who has cause to do such a
thing. He knows that Joy and I suspect him of
shooting you at North Star. He wanted to marry
her, and he knows that that is now out of the question
altogether. But he is Joy’s cousin, and Joy, as
you know, is immensely wealthy. If she died up
here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heavens! yes! And I would stake my life that
he’s the man Roger is after, the man who caused
your father’s death. He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You did not tell me!” cried Joy. “How did my
father die?”</p>

<p>“Some one blew up the ice on the river, the ice
which he was bound to pass over in the morning.
Of course the river froze over again in the night,
but it was not strong enough to carry a man, let
alone a man and a heavy sled team. He went
through&mdash;and died, but if Roger is right he was
diabolically murdered.”</p>

<p>Joy did not move. She looked at him with horror
in her eyes. Then her face grew hard. “I believe,
your cousin Roger is right. Adrian Rayner was
abroad about the time when my father must have
died. And he wanted to marry me after you had
been shot at North Star, though he could not have
been sure of your death.... It was my money he
was after, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s after it yet!” cried Bracknell with conviction,
“Miss La Farge is right. If you died up
here&mdash;but have you made a will?”</p>

<p>Joy shook her head. “It was never suggested to
me!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;for a very good reason. As your next of
kin Rayner and his father would step in if you died.
The fellow has been working to that end all the time&mdash;he’s
working now! And he’s cunning&mdash;most
damnably cunning. The way he arranged your
father’s death proves that, and if Miss La Farge
here is right, and Adrian Rayner is the man behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the gun, then we’re in a hole. The fellow will show
us no mercy. He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“S-s-s-h-h!”</p>

<p>As she gave the warning, Miss La Farge lifted a
hand, in signal for silence, and bent forward in a
listening attitude. The other two listened also, but
heard nothing save the splutter and hiss of the logs
on the fire.</p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Bracknell.</p>

<p>“Some one walked round the cabin. I heard him
quite plainly. Ah&mdash;again.”</p>

<p>They listened. Crunch! crunch! came the sound
of footsteps in the frozen snow outside. All round
the cabin the steps passed, slowly, as if some one
were making an inspection, and whilst they still sat
listening, the steps receded and passed out of earshot.
They looked at one another and Bracknell
was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>“A pretty cool customer, whoever he is! He was
spying out the land.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” answered Miss La Farge in a half
whisper.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he will do?” said Joy.</p>

<p>“Nothing, if he is wise,” answered Bracknell
slowly. “Having walked round he’ll have made the
discovery that we keep our wood at the rear of the
cabin, and he’ll easily guess that we have no great
stock inside. He has only to wait until the necessity
for replenishing the stock arrives, and then he can
get one of us at any rate.... He’ll know we have
no dogs, and that we are tied to the cabin&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But are we?” interjected Joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, the open trail without dogs is a risk that
few men would care to undertake. I’ve been at it
on one or two occasions, carrying my own stores,
and it’s not a course to be recommended. The
trail&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But we’ve very few stores to pack!” said Joy
obstinately, “and if we stay here we shall be driven
out by hunger. Do you know of any tribe of Indians
in the neighborhood?”</p>

<p>Bracknell nodded. “There’s an encampment
thirty or forty miles to the North on the Wolverine.
Joe was talking to me about them the other day, and
we considered once over whether we’d pay them a
call or not. In the end we decided against it.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well,” was the reply, “they’re rather a pagan
lot, and not over scrupulous. Joe was telling me
that in times of scarcity they sometimes offer sacrifices&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sacrifices! What kind of sacrifices?”’</p>

<p>“Well, the most barbaric sort&mdash;human. There
are some queer things done North of the Barrens,
I can tell you. The world up here is still a primitive
world, and the police patrol up the Mackenzie to
Herschell Island can’t possibly take note of anything
that doesn’t come right under its nose.”</p>

<p>“But the Indians cannot possibly be worse than
Adrian Rayner!”</p>

<p>“No!” Bracknell laughed hoarsely. “He’s a
tiger, for certain. Though I will own he didn’t look
it when he was here the other day.” He was silent
for a moment, then he said slowly, “Of course if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
decide to leave the cabin and if we go North, we may
stumble on my Cousin Roger. It’s only a chance,
but&mdash;&mdash;” He broke off again, and looked at Joy as
if wondering how she would take the suggestion,
then added, “Well, we might take it, if we can manage
to get away from here. What do you think?”</p>

<p>Joy hesitated. Her face flushed a little, then she
said quietly, “I put myself in your hands.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I am&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A fit of coughing broke in on his speech, and when
it had passed he did not attempt to complete his
sentence, but as his eyes from time to time fell on
her there was a soft glow in them, which revealed an
unspoken gratitude.</p>

<p>They sat for a long time discussing the desperate
situation, and late in the afternoon prepared for
departure. Such food as the cabin held was made
up in three packs, and when that was done, and all
was ready, they rested, waiting for the hour of
departure, Joy reflecting on the strange irony of
circumstances which now made her dependent for
help on the man who had so wronged her, and
of whom she had lived in fear.</p>

<p>All was quiet outside and Babette was offering
a tentative suggestion that perhaps after all the
enemy outside had withdrawn, then again they
caught the crunch! crunch! of cautious feet on the
frozen snow, and as all three grew alert, they heard
the steps pause by the door, and the next moment
there was a rustling sound on the rough woodwork.</p>

<p>“Somebody feeling for the latch-string,” whispered
Bracknell, then he hailed the intruder, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
latter having found the string thrust a heavy
shoulder against the barred door. “Hallo! Who
goes there?”</p>

<p>To this challenge there was no reply, but a second
or two later they again heard the steps receding
across the snow.</p>

<p>“Came to make sure we were still here,” commented
Bracknell in a low voice, “and whoever he
was he has made a bee line from the door. That
means that the camp they’re sitting in is somewhere
in front; and in all probability they’ve forgotten
the window at the back, or as it’s blocked with snow
haven’t noticed it. We shall be able to quit that
way.”</p>

<p>They waited a little time longer, and then removed
the moose hide from the window and very
cautiously began to cut away the snow with which
it had been blocked. That done they listened. No
sound whatever was to be heard. Bracknell put out
his head and peered into the darkness. There was
nothing visible save the foreground of snow and the
shadowy background of the forest. He climbed
out, and very cautiously crept to the corner of the
cabin to reconnoitre. In the shadow of the trees on
the other side of the creek he caught the glow of a
fire and discerned three men sitting round it. At
that sight he crept back, and, whispering to the
two girls to be very careful, assisted them out of the
narrow window. Then without pausing they stole
quietly across to the shadow of the sheltering
woods.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">TO THE RESCUE</p>

<p class="drop-cap07"><span class="beg">“SIBOU</span> there is some one coming up the
trail!” As he spoke to his native companion,
Corporal Bracknell pointed down
the river. The Indian paused in the very midst of
what he was doing, and looked in the direction indicated,
then he nodded, and in his own speech
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, one man and a dog-team.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if by any chance it can be the man we
are looking for, the man who was with you when
the trail was destroyed before Rolf Gargrave.”</p>

<p>“Who can say?” answered the Indian. “He has
been long on the trail. He marches wearily.”</p>

<p>“It will be as well to take no chances. If he
sees our fire he is almost certain to make for it, and
if we go back in the trees a little way we shall be
able to inspect him before he sees us. Then if he
is our man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We shall get him? Yes! And we will take
him down to the Great White Chief at Regina, who
will hang him. It is good. See, he has seen the
fire, he is turning inward to this bank.”</p>

<p>“Then we will withdraw.”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell stretched a hand for his rifle,
and together they retreated to the undergrowth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
behind their camp, where, crouching low, they
watched the advent of the stranger. As the new-comer’s
dogs moved shorewards they began to yelp,
and their own dogs, leaping up, gave tongue
menacingly. The driver of the team, however,
moved in front, and as one of the huskies flung itself
upon the harnessed dogs, brought the stock of his
whip down so smartly on it, that, yelping agony, it
retreated. The rest of the corporal’s dogs, undeterred,
sprang forward, and for a moment the new-comer
was the centre of a huddled tangle of snarling
and yelping dogs. He laid about him valiantly with
his clubbed whip, but the brutes were too much
for him, and at last he cried aloud for help. At the
cry Sibou rose suddenly to his feet.</p>

<p>“That not white man,” he said. “He Indian!”</p>

<p>Thus assured Bracknell and he ran to the help
of the new-comer, and within two minutes the tangle
of dogs was separated, and the three men found
time to look at each other. As the stranger’s eyes
fell on the corporal, he gave a sudden cry of joy and
relief, and ran to him.</p>

<p>“You know me! I come from North Star. I
Jim, Miss Gargrave’s man!”</p>

<p>The corporal looked at him and then recognized
him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I know you. You are Indian
George’s son. What&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a stream of words, half
incoherent, half intelligible, which, as it flowed on,
made his face go very white. He listened carefully,
trying to get a clear idea of the story which
the lad was telling him, and as it ended he nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I understand what you are trying to
tell me, Jim. Some one has killed your father.
Some one fired a gun at you, and you are afraid for
your mistress and Miss La Farge and you want me
to help. That is so? Very good! We are just
about to have supper and you will join us. We will
eat first, and afterwards talk. I have no doubt
you are very impatient, but your dogs are fagged
and so are mine. It is impossible to travel until
they have rested. Feed your dogs and come
along.”</p>

<p>Himself the prey of consuming anxiety, he helped
to prepare the evening meal, forced himself to eat,
and not until he had lit his pipe did he refer to the
story which the Indian lad had told him so incoherently.</p>

<p>“Now, Jim,” he said, “let us get at the facts
if we can. You say that your mistress and Miss
La Farge are here in the North, and that they are
on trail?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“But I thought they were in England?”</p>

<p>“They returned suddenly, fourteen days ago!”</p>

<p>“But what were they doing on trail, so far from
home, with the spring coming?”</p>

<p>“I do not know clearly. But they were looking
for you. They had news for you. More than that
was not told my father.”</p>

<p>“And you say that yester morning a strange
Indian came to your camp with a message from a
white man?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The white man was sick. He desired to
talk with Miss Gargrave; so whilst we&mdash;my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and I struck camp, Miss La Farge and my mistress
went to the cabin which was on a creek&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!” interrupted the corporal. “Was it on
the left bank?”</p>

<p>“Yes! The left bank. The word was that we
should pack and bring the dogs and the sled to the
mouth of the creek there to wait for Miss Gargrave.
We did so, and were standing, stamping our feet
for warmth, when my father gave a cry like that of
a man whom death strikes and fell into the snow.
I was a little way from him, and ran towards him.
As I reached him his spirit passed, and looking down
I saw that he had been struck with an arrow.”</p>

<p>“Indians!” ejaculated the corporal.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell. I looked about and I saw three
men in the shadow of the wood. Their faces were
hidden from me, and I could not see them clearly.
One carried a rifle which he fired at me. Our rifles,
mine and that of my father, were lashed on the sled
and I was helpless.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” asked the corporal.</p>

<p>“I lashed the dogs and fled, clinging to the gee-pole.
The trail was good and I made speed. It
was in my mind that the man with the rifle would
fire again, but he did not do so, though twice or
thrice arrows fell near me, and I knew that I was
followed. It was in my mind that when the pursuit
was over I would go back, and I made for the woods
on the further side of the river, and when darkness
came I crept down the trail, and leaving my dogs
crossed the river to the creek.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Yes? What did you find?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“I found my father’s body gone, and at the head
of the creek opposite a cabin a camp was pitched
and a fire lighted, and whilst I watched a man left
the camp and went towards the cabin. I could not
see what he did, but it is in my mind that the men
in the camp keep watch on the cabin.”</p>

<p>“And your mistress? Did you see anything of
her?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, but my mind says she is in the cabin,
for it was thither she went to see the sick white
man. I thought once to attack the camp, but the
men there are three, and I am but a stripling and
unused to battle. Then I bethought me of Indians
who live up the river. They are not good Indians,
but my father was known to them and I thought
that maybe they might give help. I was on my
way there, when I caught the light of your fire, and
came here, hoping to find a white man, and I find
you. It is very good. You will go back? You will
help?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I shall go back. I shall help. We must
save your mistress. I know the cabin on the creek
and I know the sick man whom she went to see;
and I do not think she will come to any harm in that
quarter. But the men in the camp, who, as you
think, watch the cabin, are different. There is
something there that I do not understand. But we
will find out ... we will rest now, and in four
hours we start. I will feed the dogs again now, for
there is a hard journey before us. The wind has
changed and the trail will soften in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is from the south. The spring is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
knocking at the door, and in a week the ice will
grow rotten, but before then we will find my
mistress!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the corporal simply. “We will
find her.”</p>

<p>The Indian had disposed his blankets near the
fire and within five minutes was sound asleep. A
little time later Sibou also slept, but Corporal Bracknell
made no attempt to close his eyes, since he knew
that for him sleep was impossible. He lit his pipe,
and sat staring into the fire, the prey of gnawing
anxiety. The mystery of the men in the camp
who watched Dick Bracknell’s cabin, utterly confounded
him. Were they men whom his cousin
had wronged during his none too scrupulous career
in the North? That was just possible. Daily,
men in those wild latitudes took the law into their
own hands, enforcing verdicts that not infrequently
were more just than those of the law itself. Were
these men of that type? Then his mind dismissed
the suggestion. In that case why had they killed
George, and attacked his son, the lad who, overborne
by his labours, was now sleeping there on the
other side of the fire?</p>

<p>They might be roving Indians. The use of
arrows suggested that, but one had a rifle&mdash;&mdash; Suddenly
he sat bolt upright, his eyes staring widely,
as another possibility flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>“Adrian Rayner!”</p>

<p>He was appalled at the thought, but the more he
dwelt upon it, the stronger his suspicion grew.
Adrian Rayner was in the North and he had two
Indians with him, “bad men,” as Chief Louis had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
said. The corporal was morally certain that
Rayner was the man who had made the attempt on
Dick Bracknell at North Star; and if he knew that
he were still alive, what more likely than that
he should make a second attempt? There was
nothing surprising about that, but the attack on
Joy Gargrave’s party was something that passed his
comprehension altogether. Try as he would he
could find no sufficient explanation for that, the one
possibility that presented itself to his mind being
that Adrian Rayner was for some reason anxious to
make Joy dependent upon himself, and so had
deliberately set out to destroy her escort. Then
the thought suggested itself to him that after all
he might be building on a false assumption. The
man responsible for the death of George, and for
the attack on the cabin, might not be Rayner at all.</p>

<p>Restlessly his mind groped among the possibilities
which the mystery suggested, and not once
during the four hours that he had decreed for rest
did his eyes shut. At the end of that time he
wakened Sibou, and, impatient to get away himself,
helped in the preparation for making a start, allowing
the boy Jim to sleep until the last available
moment, and when at last they took the trail he
was conscious of relief. It was at least something
to feel that he was on his way to the help of Joy.</p>

<p>They travelled six hours and then made a halt
for a brief rest and a meal, afterwards resuming
their way. As noon approached they found the
hard crust of the snow softening, and the going
becoming harder, but there was no slackening of
effort, and late in the afternoon they arrived at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
point opposite the creek on the far side of the river.
There in the shadow of the woods they waited till
darkness fell, and then leaving the boy in charge
of the dogs, the corporal and Sibou crossed the
river, and made a detour which would bring them
out at the head of the creek where the cabin was
located.</p>

<p>They reached the neighbourhood of their objective
in about an hour’s time, and then moved forward
with extreme caution, looking for the camp which
the boy had described as being opposite the cabin.
But no glow of blazing logs met their gaze, and the
edge of the forest presented a front of unbroken
shadow. Sibou sniffed the air thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“There is no smell of fire,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“No!” answered the corporal, his anxiety suddenly
trebled by the thought that he had arrived
too late.</p>

<p>They still crept forward, and then unexpectedly
Sibou stopped, and pointed to the ground. Roger
Bracknell looked down and saw a blackened circle
in the snow where a fire had been lit.</p>

<p>“Here was the camp,” said the Indian, and then
stopped and put his hand on the ashes. “The fire
is cold,” he said, as he stood upright again. “It
has been out for some time.”</p>

<p>For a moment they stood looking at each other,
and then instinctively both turned to look for the
cabin. It stood like a shadow against the deeper
shadow of the woods behind it, silent, and with no
sign of occupation about it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the men we seek are in the cabin,”
whispered the corporal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the Indian sniffed the air and then shook
his head.</p>

<p>“No! They are not there. There is no fire.
But we will go and find out.”</p>

<p>Carelessly, in his assurance, Sibou led the way
across the creek, and to the front of the cabin. The
door was closed, and he hammered on it with his
rifle butt. There was no answer, and, feeling for
the latch string, he thrust a shoulder against the
door. It did not yield.</p>

<p>“The door is barred,” he said aloud. “But
there is no one within, or if there is they be dead.”</p>

<p>“The window!” ejaculated the corporal, and
began to run round the cabin.</p>

<p>Reaching the window, and observing the empty
framework he felt for his matches, and then hoisting
himself up, with head and shoulders inside the
cabin, he struck a light and looked hastily round.
The cabin was empty. With something like a
groan of despair he slipped back to the ground,
and looked at Sibou.</p>

<p>“There is no one here,” he said. “They are
gone!”</p>

<p>The Indian nodded and stared at the empty
frame thoughtfully, then after a little time he
spoke.</p>

<p>“The men of the camp are gone; and those who
were in the hut are gone&mdash;whither we know not;
but those who were in the hut went out not by the
door, for the door is barred within. How did they
leave the cabin, then?” he jerked a hand upwards
towards the window. “This way! And wherefore?
Because the men in the camp were watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the door, and had left the window unguarded.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, yes,” cried the corporal, seized by new
hope. “That does seem more than likely.”</p>

<p>“Then the men in the camp discover that those
whom they watch have flown, and the cabin is
empty. They want them badly, and they follow,
therefore we find the camp empty like the cabin.”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! But where have they gone?
Which way in this God-forsaken wilderness?”</p>

<p>“That we shall know when daylight comes.
The snow will carry their trail, and we can follow.
Till then it were better to rest, for the night withholds
the knowledge.”</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell recognized the wisdom of the
Indian’s words, and condemned to inaction until
daylight, decided to make the best of it.</p>

<p>“Then there is nothing for it but to camp. And
we may as well use the cabin. Slip through the
window, Sibou, and unbar the door, whilst I go
across for Jim and the dogs.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later a fire was roaring in the
improvised stove, and by its light Roger Bracknell
wandered round the cabin, searching for anything
that would give him a clue to the mystery. He
found nothing. The hut, save for a couple of rifles
reposing in the corner, and some odds and ends of
no importance, was quite empty. He looked at the
rifles and addressed himself to Sibou.</p>

<p>“Evidently the ammunition was exhausted.”</p>

<p>“Yes! Therefore the rifles were left. But the
food was taken. Behold!”</p>

<p>The Indian pointed to a roughly made shelf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
which corresponded to the ordinary larder of a
Klondyke cabin. There was nothing there but a
coffee-sack and an empty syrup-tin.</p>

<p>“They run from the men in the camp, and leave
the rifles because they are useless, but they take
the food, and they have a start&mdash;one hour&mdash;two
hours&mdash;who can tell? But we follow in the morning
and we find both. That so?”</p>

<p>“Please God, yes!” answered the corporal
earnestly.</p>

<p>Tired out with the labours of the day, Roger
Bracknell slept long and well, and woke a little
after dawn with the smell of frying bacon in his
nostrils. The boy Jim was preparing breakfast,
but Sibou was nowhere to be seen. Questioning
Jim, he learned that the Indian had gone outside
an hour before and had not yet returned. Hastily
throwing on his furs, the corporal passed outside,
and as he did so, Sibou appeared at the edge of the
woods at the back of the cabin. There was an
impassive look on his mask-like face, but his eyes
gleamed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the corporal eagerly.</p>

<p>The Indian swept a hand towards the woods.</p>

<p>“That way have they gone. The double trail
is there. Also there is a dead man there!”</p>

<p>“A dead man?” cried the white man in sudden
fear.</p>

<p>“An Indian! I know him not!”</p>

<p>“Take me to him,” said the corporal imperatively.
Without a word Sibou turned and led the
way into the wood, and after a few minutes’ walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Roger Bracknell found himself near the mouth of
the creek, looking down into the face of a dead man.
He recognized him instantly.</p>

<p>“He is known to you?” asked Sibou.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is known to me. He was the servant of
the white man who lived in the cabin.”</p>

<p>“He was shot in the back with an arrow.”
explained Sibou. “He must have been looking down
at the trail when he died.”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell looked at the dead Indian for a
little time without speaking, then fear for what was
to come shook him.</p>

<p>“Sibou,” he said, “we must make haste. There
is not a moment to waste. Those men in the camp
are very desperate men. Two men already have
died at their hands, and they are now on the trail
of the man who was in the hut and of the ladies
whom we seek. We must follow hard!”</p>

<p>“Yes, hard!” answered Sibou simply. “It is a
trail of death!”</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were on the way once
more. A south wind was blowing, and they travelled
with furs opened, for the day was comparatively
warm, and there were many signs that spring was
at hand. The trail they followed led through the
forest for most of the time, but towards the end
of the day followed a tributary river, and here it
suddenly gathered itself together in a space of
trampled snow, which spoke of many pairs of feet.
The corporal looked at it in perplexity and watched
Sibou, who circled round and round, seeking a solution
of the enigma the trampled snow presented.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, Sibou?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not sure,” answered the Indian slowly.
“Something strange has happened. There has
been a meeting here, for there are many footmarks,
and there is a trail which goes up the river, and the
trail of the ladies is not part of it.”</p>

<p>“But where are they? They certainly came
here!”</p>

<p>“So!” answered Sibou. “And they went from
here, since they are not to be found in this place.
It is in my mind that they were carried&mdash;for there
were dogs here as well as men.”</p>

<p>“But who&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Indians! The trail is not that of white men’s
feet.”</p>

<p>“Then we must follow,” cried the corporal.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Sibou gravely. “We must
follow. But I shall go first, whilst you remain
here. If I find nothing, then I shall be back in
one hour or two. It is in my mind that there is an
encampment not far away, and it is better that we
do not take the dogs till we know. If they are bad
Indians&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“In God’s name, hurry!” cried Roger Bracknell,
his courage shaken by the thought of the new
danger into which Joy Gargrave appeared to have
fallen.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">PRISONERS</p>

<p class="drop-cap03"><span class="beg">WHEN</span> Dick Bracknell had led the way
from the cabin he knew that he was leading
a forlorn hope. It was possible that
many hours would pass before the men in the camp
discovered their flight; whilst on the other hand the
discovery might be made immediately and, in that
case, as the ruthlessness of the attackers had shown,
there was little hope of escape. But there were
dangers before as well as behind, and the wilderness
of the North was itself the greatest danger. They
had little food, he himself was a very sick man,
ill-fitted for the strenuous toil which the situation
called for, and in the woods wild beasts and wild
men might lurk, against whom, armed merely with
pistols and hunting knives, they would be almost
helpless. All this he knew, but braced himself for
the task before him, determined at all costs to save
the two girls and to win Joy’s respect if that was
at all possible.</p>

<p>When they won to the darkness of the forest
without discovery, he breathed more freely, and
pushed on along an ill-defined track, which he
seemed to know well. As the night wore on, he
grew unutterably tired, and once when he was
overtaken by a fit of coughing, which left him terribly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
exhausted, Joy suggested that they should rest
for a little while.</p>

<p>“Are you too tired to continue?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” she answered quickly.</p>

<p>“Then we will keep on.”</p>

<p>“But you are not fit to do so,” she protested.
“Your cough&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What do I matter?” he replied with a mirthless
laugh. “I am done for in any case, and we must
be a long way from here before morning. This is
the only service I shall ever be able to render you,
and you are not going to deny me the chance of
atonement which it gives, are you?”</p>

<p>“I was not thinking of that!” answered Joy
gently. “I was thinking only of you.”</p>

<p>“And I am thinking only of you!” he retorted
quickly. “I have thought of myself too long. I
am very glad to have this opportunity of service,
however I may regret the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I am very grateful to you,” was Joy’s reply, and
without further words they started anew upon their
way.</p>

<p>Once they stopped, and ate a little food which had
been prepared before leaving the cabin, and then
pushed on until dawn, when a fire was lit, and a
halt for a couple of hours was made. At the end
of that time they resumed their desperate journey,
and an hour later struck the river for which Dick
Bracknell had been making. A look of relief came
on his haggard face as he saw it.</p>

<p>“It will be easier now,” he said, “and unless the
Indians have removed we shall reach the encampment
all right now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Unless those men overtake us!”</p>

<p>“Yes! In that case we are up a tree.”</p>

<p>“And of course if the Indians are hospitable we&mdash;- Ah!
Look there?”</p>

<p>She indicated a point a little way up the river. A
man had emerged from the trees. He stood there
regarding them for a moment, then without a sign
he withdrew.</p>

<p>“An Indian,” said Joy quickly. “I am sure of
it!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dick Bracknell slowly, “an
Indian. But he may be one of these men who are
following us. The question is, what are we to do?
Our way lies up river.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will be better if we take to the woods
again,” suggested Miss La Farge.</p>

<p>“There is little to be gained by doing that,”
replied Bracknell. “The man has seen us, and if
he is hostile he will follow. The only course, I
think, is to keep straight on.”</p>

<p>They were still discussing when Joy broke in.</p>

<p>“The question is solved for us,” she said quickly.
“There are men in the wood behind us. See!”</p>

<p>She had scarcely spoken when an Indian stepped
from the wood, and another followed, and another
until seven men stood on the trail.</p>

<p>“How!” said the leader, approaching them.</p>

<p>Bracknell replied to the salutation, and the man
spoke to his companions who drew nearer, apparently
quite friendly disposed to them. Then came
a change. One of the men stepped forward,
looked at the white man, and gave a sudden exclamation.
Then he turned towards his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and addressed them volubly. Joy strove to catch
what he was saying, but the dialect in which he
spoke was strange to her, and she could make nothing
of his words. It was clear to her, however, that
the man was excited, and as he spoke the excitement
communicated itself to his companions. Joy looked
at Dick Bracknell for an explanation, and found that
his face was very white.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked quickly. “Something
has gone wrong?”</p>

<p>“Yes, terribly wrong. These men will be merciless.
I have done you my last dis-service.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she questioned, as she
looked at the gesticulating natives.</p>

<p>“I did this tribe a grave wrong, two years ago.
One of the men has recognized me, and I think
there is little hope for us. We might put up a
fight, but it would probably be little use, and would
certainly jeopardize your life as well as mine. If
they get me, they may let you go. It is worth
trying. I will explain and perhaps&mdash;&mdash;” He
broke off and took a step forward.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” inquired Joy
sharply.</p>

<p>“Just going to try what a little explanation will
do,” he answered, “a little explanation coupled
with persuasion.”</p>

<p>“No!” she replied quickly. “You are going to
make a bargain with those men. I know you are,
and I shall not agree. We stand or fall together.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you are wise?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I do not know whether I am wise or not,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
answered firmly. “But I keep the faith of the trail,
and I shall not leave you in the lurch. Neither
will Babette, I am sure.”</p>

<p>As he regarded her, a strange look came into
his eyes, a look of mingled pride and pain.</p>

<p>“Joy,” he said brokenly, “you are a great
woman and I was never worthy of you!... You
can take your chances with me if you like. When
I come to think upon it they are perhaps as good
as those that wandering in the wilderness, short of
stores, offers. They may spare you; who knows?
And it is coming spring. You can feel it in the
air. A few days and the river will begin to break
up, and then will come white men, prospectors and
what not. You may have a chance.”</p>

<p>“It is by that chance I shall abide,” Joy replied,
“and not by any that leaves you to the mercy of
savages.”</p>

<p>The Indians finished their confabulation and the
leader stepped forward again, and with lowering
looks addressed himself to Dick Bracknell, who
nodded and then handed over his pistol and hunting
knife, and with his back to Joy addressed her in
warning.</p>

<p>“Keep your pistol out of sight, Joy. These
brutes will not suspect you are carrying one, and we
may yet find it very useful. They demand that
we accompany them to their encampment up the
river. I have agreed, since there is nothing else
that I can do. I do not think they will hurt you
or Miss La Farge&mdash;yet.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they started and presently
arrived at an encampment consisting of perhaps a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
score of tepees. Dogs greeted their coming noisily,
children and women came out of the skin tents to
look at them, and a few men joined their captors
as they moved towards the centre of the camp.
Just as they halted, a tall Indian came out of one
of the tents, and by his side tottered a man who
seemed incredibly old, but though his step was
feeble, his eyes were keen, and as they fell on Dick
Bracknell they lighted with sudden ferocity, and
as she caught the glare he directed towards them,
Joy felt the clutch of fear at her heart.</p>

<p>“Who is that old man?” she asked. “He
knows you. I saw the recognition leap in his eyes.”</p>

<p>“He is the Shaman&mdash;the tribal witch-doctor,
you know. I am afraid his recognition of me is not
a propitious one. He is a ferocious old beast, and
he owes me one.”</p>

<p>“What have you done to the tribe,” asked Joy
curiously, “that all of them should be against you?”</p>

<p>Bracknell laughed shortly. “I am afraid I cannot
unfold the record of that particular sin for
your gaze. It was a wild, mad thing, but it seemed
all right at the time. Now I think I shall have to
pay for it&mdash;and you too. I seem to be your evil
genius,” he added penitently.</p>

<p>Joy did not reply. She was watching the proceedings
of the Shaman, who after listening to their
captors, tottered up to Bracknell and surveyed him
with eyes that were gloating and cruel. Joy
shuddered as she read the evil triumph in the old
savage’s face, and looked at her husband. Apparently
he was altogether composed, and there was a
contemptuous look on his haggard face. Joy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
conscious of a certain thrill of pride as she looked
at him. Dick Bracknell might have many weaknesses,
but cowardice was not one of them. Then
the Shaman spoke, mumbling through toothless
gums, and though she did not understand a single
word of what he was saying, Joy caught the rasping
menace in his voice and shuddered again. The
Shaman laughed as he broke off, a throaty, croaking
laugh, which seemed unutterably evil; and a
moment later they were hurried to one of the
tepees and the skin door was thrown together and
lashed outside. In the darkness, Joy spoke.</p>

<p>“What was that old savage saying to you,
Dick?”</p>

<p>Bracknell laughed shortly. “Oh, he was promising
himself pleasure and me pain, indeed my pain
was to be his pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You mean they are going to torture
you?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder!”</p>

<p>“Will they be long before&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Tonight, I fancy! It seems the tribe is in
luck. A couple of moose were killed this morning,
and a potlatch&mdash;sort of tribal bean-feast, you know&mdash;is
arranged for tonight and most of them will
gorge. The Shaman will no doubt arrange some
form of entertainment in which I shall take a star
part!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is dreadful!” cried Joy.</p>

<p>In the darkness she heard Dick Bracknell draw
his breath sharply, and a second later a hand
touched hers. She did not shrink, but remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
quite still, and then heard him speak in a broken,
stammering whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>“My dear ... I’m infernally sorry ... to have
brought you into this mess, I ... I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We shall have to get away before,” broke in
Joy’s voice. “We can’t remain here and wait for
a thing like that to happen.”</p>

<p>“What will it matter?” he asked lightly. “It
will be the end&mdash;for me. But if it will save you,
I do not care.”</p>

<p>Joy did not answer, she knew that he was sincere,
but she did not know what to say, and presently
he spoke again&mdash;</p>

<p>“I do not know what we can do. If we try to
get away they will follow, and they will travel
faster than we shall. And besides, with the food
gone the attempt would be hopeless. One cannot go
into the wilderness without grub.”</p>

<p>They sat discussing the situation quietly, and
outside, the clamour of the camp grew. Once Joy,
finding a small hole in the tent, peeped out. On
the edge of the encampment a great fire had been
lit, and around it a number of women and men
were engaged in trampling the snow hard. She
guessed that it was there that the potlatch was to
be held, and wondered what would happen when the
Indians had feasted. The uncouth figures moving
to and fro, and cut out from the deepening darkness
by the glow of the fire, seemed inconceivably wild
and grotesque, and once, when the strange form of
the Shaman shuffled into view, and stood gesticulating
and pointing to the tepee, she shuddered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>She knew that these men were as the men of the
Stone Age, that pity was a quality to which they
were strangers, and that they would do things
which, merely to think of, made her shake with
terror.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried sharply, “is there nothing that
we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush!” broke in Dick Bracknell’s voice peremptorily.
“Listen!”</p>

<p>All three listened. Some one was fumbling at
the back of the tent, then presently there came a
ripping noise, and a voice whispered, “Are you
there?”</p>

<p>Even at that moment Joy Gargrave’s heart
leaped as she recognized it.</p>

<p>“Yes, Corporal Bracknell. Your cousin, Babette
and myself are here.”</p>

<p>“Can you move? Are you free?”</p>

<p>“Quite free.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, then.” The sound of slitting
hide was heard once more, then came the corporal’s
voice again, “You must slip out through the hole
I have cut. Quickly! There is not a moment
to lose.”</p>

<p>Joy felt herself propelled forward and thrust
through the opening which the corporal had cut,
and whilst another pair of hands guided her, caught
Dick Bracknell’s whisper, “Now&mdash;Miss La
Farge!”</p>

<p>Babette slipped out, and two seconds later Dick
Bracknell followed.</p>

<p>“This way,” said the corporal quickly. “As
silently as you can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>He led the way through the darkness to the river
bank, and as they began to descend he whispered
to Joy&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your boy Jim, and my man Sibou, are waiting
for us with the dogs, a little way off.”</p>

<p>“Then Jim is safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he found me, and told me what had happened
to&mdash;&mdash; By George, listen!”</p>

<p>An ear-splitting yell sounded from the direction
of the encampment. It was followed by another,
and that by a great clamour.</p>

<p>“They have discovered our escape,” said Dick
Bracknell grimly. “Hurry! where are you taking
us, Roger? Have you a rifle?”</p>

<p>“Yes! I have a rifle&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then give it me. Listen to that! The hunt
is up. Give me the gun. I’ll hold the pass.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he laughed a laugh that sounded
harshly in the night, then broke off. “Great
Scott! They’re in front of us already! Look
there!”</p>

<p>The dark figures had appeared on the snow in
front, but the corporal quickly dispelled the fears
their appearance had awakened.</p>

<p>“My man, and the boy Jim! Hurry! Those
beggars behind are following fast.”</p>

<p>Dick Bracknell looked round. Against the red
glare of the great camp fire half a score of dark
figures showed plainly. They were running towards
the fugitives. An exultant yell told the latter that
they had been seen.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, give me the rifle, and get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
girls away, Roger, old man. I’m crocked, and can’t
travel fast, but I can hold those devils back.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see this is my chance of doing the
decent thing? For God’s sake don’t deny me,
man!”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell looked into his cousin’s haggard
face, and understood. Silently he put his rifle into
his cousin’s hand, and unbuckling his bandolier,
threw it on him.</p>

<p>“Thanks, old man! Thanks, awfully!”</p>

<p>“I’ll send my man to back you, and when I’ve
started the girls I’ll return myself.”</p>

<p>“No!” replied Dick Bracknell. “You go with
them. You must! It’s necessary.” He lifted the
rifle as he spoke and sighting at the foremost of the
pursuers pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>“One!” he said exultantly, as one of the running
shadows toppled into the snow. “The beggars
aren’t thinking of the light behind them....
Go!” he said again. “Go with the girls and send
your man. Let me play the hero for once....
Man!” he blazed suddenly, “can’t you see it is all
that is left to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied his cousin, “I can see it, and I’ll
go. But you must promise me that you won’t stay
longer than&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The rifle cracked again, and then Dick Bracknell
replied. “I’ll promise anything you like if you’ll
only go and get Joy away.”</p>

<p>Then, very reluctantly, Corporal Bracknell went.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PRODIGAL MAKES GOOD</p>

<p class="drop-cap06"><span class="beg">“DICK INSISTED</span>,” explained Corporal Bracknell,
as with Joy and her foster-sister and
the boy Jim he fled down the river. “I
could see he wanted the post of danger&mdash;and I
could not refuse. Sibou is with him, and I think
they will hold the pursuit.”</p>

<p>For a moment Joy did not speak. She was
thinking of the consideration Dick Bracknell had
shown to her during the last two days, and understood
quite well that now he was endeavouring to
atone for the wrong he had once done her. Pity
surged in her heart as she thought of him weak and
ill, holding back a horde of savage men, pity and
gratitude, but no warmer emotion, for Dick Bracknell
had killed all possibility of that in that moment
at Alcombe, when, on her marriage morning she
had made that startling discovery of his perfidy.</p>

<p>“Do you think that&mdash;that Dick will get away
also?” she asked at last.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” the corporal answered evasively.
“I made him promise not to stay too long. But
he is a sick man and in the mood for anything. I
believed he rejoiced at the prospect of a fight
against odds. It is not surprising and&mdash;&mdash; Listen!
There they go again. They were both together
that time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>From time to time as they raced hot-foot down
the trail the reports of rifles reached them, and
they knew that the fight was still proceeding, and
that the two defenders were holding their own.
Once when the interval between the shots was
especially long, Corporal Bracknell’s face grew very
thoughtful, and so absorbed and intent was he that
Joy addressed a question to him twice before he
heard her.</p>

<p>“Corporal Bracknell, do you think that Dick can
recover from his sickness?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” replied the corporal slowly,
then gave an ejaculation as the distant report of a
rifle broke the silence behind them. “Good!
They’re still keeping it up.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Because I have seen other men like it. I have
never known one to recover.”</p>

<p>“Do ... do you think Dick knows?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered quietly. “I am sure of it!”</p>

<p>“It is very pitiful,” she said. “He is not all
bad&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He is very far from being that,” interrupted
the corporal.</p>

<p>“He might have made good, even yet, if he were
not so sick.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is making good,” replied the corporal
gently.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered simply. “I think he is trying.
In spite of the past I shall be in his debt.
Ah! What is that?”</p>

<p>There had been a sudden increase of clamour
behind them. Distant yells were sounding, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
two rifles were firing in rapid succession. For
perhaps a minute and a half this went on, then
came silence, followed by a single shot, and that
again by a silence which remained unbroken.
Corporal Bracknell stopped irresolutely.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” Joy whispered.</p>

<p>“I think it is the end one way or the other,”
was the reply. “The last yell sounded as if the
Indians were charging. In that case, unless the
rush was stopped&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dick and your man are dead?”</p>

<p>“Something of that kind. I think I must go
back, and try and learn what has happened. There
is nothing else for it. I simply can’t desert them
without knowing what has befallen. You keep right
on until you reach the main river&mdash;I will not be
longer than necessary.”</p>

<p>“We shall wait at the fork,” she answered
quickly.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We shall wait,” she repeated resolutely, and
taking a rifle from one of the sleds, she handed it to
him.</p>

<p>“You may need it,” she said quietly. “And we
have one left yet.”</p>

<p>He did not speak, but nodding his thanks, turned
in the tracks, and proceeded up river once more.
He went swiftly but cautiously; and after travelling
half an hour, caught sight of a lumpy shadow coming
down the river. Hastily he took refuge against
the bank, and waited with his rifle ready. The
shadow drew nearer, and then he perceived that it
was made up of two men, one riding on the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the other. At the same time he caught the sound
of a protesting voice&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s not worth while, old horse. Put me down
and quit. They say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A moment later Roger Bracknell was running
towards them.</p>

<p>“Dick! Dick!” he cried gladly.</p>

<p>“Where ... where ... are the girls ... Joy?”
asked his cousin in a voice that sounded harsh.</p>

<p>“They are all right. They are well in front!”</p>

<p>“Good!” There was a note of relief in Dick
Bracknell’s voice, as he spoke, then he gave a
little laugh. “Behold the victors! Roger, my son,
it was topping. We stood a charge and ... and
cleared the board. It was gorgeous.”</p>

<p>He laughed weakly, and his cousin looked at
him anxiously.</p>

<p>“But you are hurt, Dick, old man?”</p>

<p>“Plugged ... with an arrow ... in the ribs.
Sibou’s all right, though. And I tried to make
him ... leave me ... on the field of glory. B&mdash;but
he’s a mutinous beggar.”</p>

<p>Weak though he was, there was a reckless gaiety
in his manner, which almost moved the corporal to
tears.</p>

<p>“Dick, don’t you think you had better not talk?
It’s bound to try you, as you are. When we get
to the sleds I will look to your wound, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of use, Roger, my boy! I know it,
you know it! This finishes me. It was a matter
of weeks, before; now it’s a matter of hours....
All the same ... I’d like to ... to see Joy,
b-before&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“You shall, if it’s to be done,” said his cousin
as the other’s voice broke. “I’ll take turns with
Sibou. Between us we’ll do it, somehow. And I
might as well take part of my share now. Sibou
must be fagged.”</p>

<p>They stopped and the transfer was effected, then
as they resumed their way, the wounded man leaned
over his cousin’s shoulder, and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Roger you’re a good sort!”</p>

<p>The corporal made no response, and Dick Bracknell
continued, “You know that Joy was up here
looking for you?”</p>

<p>“The boy, Jim, told me so. Though why she
should&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She ... she came to tell you that ... Geoff
was dead ... that you are the heir of Harrow
Fell&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No! No!” broke out his cousin in sharp
protest.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! It is so. I’ve been out of it since&mdash;oh,
for years! And in any case ... I shall be
out of it ... altogether very soon. But it wasn’t
for that only ... Joy came. She came up here
to stop you from killing me ... knowing the
relation between us, she was afraid that if that happened,
people would say that you ... that you....
You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I understand.”</p>

<p>“Such a possibility was rather rot, of course, but
Joy didn’t know that, and she knew that you were
after me. So&mdash;she’s pure gold, Joy is.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the corporal simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll marry her, of course, and go to ... to
the Fell?”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell hesitated. The conversation
was inexpressibly painful to him, and to this question
he did not know what answer to make. His
cousin did not seem to notice the hesitation, and he
did not wait for an answer, but continued in a
broken way, “There have been Bracknells at the Fell
these five hundred years.... And Geoff’s gone,
and I’m going, but you’ll ... keep up the line.
When you’ve a boy, Roger, call him ... call him
Dick. I’d like to think there’ll be one of my name
who’ll be as clean and straight as I’ve been crooked.
Lord! What a mess a man can make of life!
And what a difference it would have made ... if
only I’d gone straight at the fences. But would
it?... Joy would never have married me ...
she never loved me, but you have her heart! Oh,
it is so ... I’m not blind, and, Roger, old man,
I’m glad it will be you.”</p>

<p>After that he was silent for a long time, to
Roger’s unutterable relief, and he spoke only jestingly
on the occasions when Sibou and the corporal
took him over from the other, and at last, after a
weary march, they reached the point where the
stream joined the main river, and as they did so
a figure broke from the bank and ran towards them.
It was Joy.</p>

<p>“You are all here?” she cried. “Safe?”</p>

<p>“Safe! Yes,” laughed Dick weakly. “But a
little damaged.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked, turning towards the
corporal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dick is wounded,” he answered gravely. “I am
afraid it is serious. And as I think we have little
to fear from the Indians now, it will perhaps be
best if we cross the main river and camp. We can
put him upon one of the sleds&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!” she cried, and a moment later she
had turned to the wounded man, and was talking to
him in a low voice.</p>

<p>Roger moved away. He did not know what she
was saying and he had no wish to know, but half
an hour later as his cousin lay by a fire which had
been lit, he saw that his eyes were shining with a
quiet happiness.</p>

<p>“Better, Dick?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“In soul, yes!” was the answer.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” replied the corporal simply.</p>

<p>“It’s like a cleansing to have a good woman’s
approval. You can’t know, Roger, old boy. You
haven’t been deep in the mire&mdash;but there it is.”</p>

<p>He allowed his cousin and Joy to examine his
wound, and they found the arrow broken off in his
side. The corporal looked at the girl and shook
his head. There was little to be done, except draw
out the arrow, and bandage the wound as well as
they could, and when that was done the injured
man was visibly weaker.</p>

<p>Corporal Bracknell busied himself with the preparation
of a meal, leaving Joy and his cousin together,
and not till after the meal when Dick was
dozing had he any opportunity of further speech
with Joy. Then walking in the shadow of the trees
he talked with her.</p>

<p>“Dick has told me why you came,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
going straight to his point. “I am very grateful.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid that there might be trouble between
you,” she answered frankly.</p>

<p>“We had already met twice, before you came,”
he explained quietly. “On the first occasion Dick
spared my life; and on the second, though the meeting
began stormily enough, we parted complete
friends.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that, more glad than I can tell.”</p>

<p>“Not more than I am. But there are things I
want to ask you, very badly. I know how you
came to go to Dick’s cabin, but I do not know who
those men were who kept both Dick and you there
in a state of siege. Have you any idea?”</p>

<p>As he asked the question Joy Gargrave’s face
grew very thoughtful.</p>

<p>“It was Dick’s man who fastened the door on
us. That was part of a plan for kidnapping me,
which Dick had arranged, and at first I thought that
he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was not Joe. We found him shot,” interrupted
the corporal.</p>

<p>“I do not think it was he now. At first Dick
was inclined to that idea, and then he thought it
might be my boy, Jim; but I pointed out that the
latter would scarcely attack Babette, and she was
attacked whilst walking outside the hut, you know.”</p>

<p>He looked at her and saw that her eyes were full
of trouble. She was keeping something back, and
after a moment he pressed her for the truth.</p>

<p>“You have suspicions, Miss Gargrave. Tell me
exactly what you think.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely like to,” was the reply. “What I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
have is no more than a suspicion, and it is almost
too horrible for words.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he urged again.</p>

<p>“I will,” she broke out impulsively, “and God
forgive me if I do him wrong! I think my cousin
Adrian was responsible&mdash;Mr. Rayner, you know,
whom you met at North Star.”</p>

<p>“I thought so.”</p>

<p>“You thought so?” she cried. “Then you know
he was up here?”</p>

<p>“I did not know, but I guessed. I was on his
trail when I met your boy Jim.”</p>

<p>“And he was on yours, I am sure,” said Joy
quickly. “He followed you when you left Dick’s
cabin. I think he meant to kill you. He knew
that you suspected him of that attack on Dick at
North Star&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I suspected him of worse things than that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. Dick told me. Oh, how terrible
it is!”</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands for a moment, and
then as she lifted it, he asked, “Have you any
idea why he should do a thing like that, or why he
should make an attempt upon you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied in a shaking voice. “Babette,
who is very frank, says he wants my money. He
would have married me, knowing all the time that
I was married to Dick. He even threatened me
when I would not accept him, and events have compelled
me to the belief that Babette is right, and
that he will allow nothing to stand in his way, not
even my life.”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you are right,” he answered slowly.
“We must be very careful. If there is real warrant
for our suspicions, then Adrian Rayner will be a
very desperate man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am sure of that,” she interjected impulsively.
“I felt it, when he left North Star on our arrival.
Did I tell you that he was there when we came
back? No! Well, he was, and I ordered him
away, and as soon as I could I came to look for
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was good of you to be so anxious for my
welfare,” he broke in quickly.</p>

<p>They had turned and were walking back to the
fire, and in the light it shed he saw her face grow
suddenly crimson. She looked towards the recumbent
figure of Dick Bracknell, lying towards the
fire, then back again to himself.</p>

<p>“That was but natural,” she said quietly. “You
were working for me, and when I knew that a
danger unknown to you threatened you, I felt that
I must make you aware of it. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered quietly. “And if we can
only meet Adrian Rayner we shall be able to prove
or disprove all that we suspect. You and Babette
and myself know him and Sibou knows the man
who was responsible for your father’s death. If
Adrian Rayner and he should prove to be the
same, then the matter will be beyond dispute.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed slowly. “Yes. But it will
be very terrible.”</p>

<p>They approached the fire, just as Dick Bracknell
moved and opened his eyes. He looked at Joy,
and she, reading the unspoken request in his eyes,
went and seated herself by his side.</p>

<h2 >CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="pch">A SNOW-BLIND MAN</p>

<p class="drop-cap03"><span class="beg">WHEN</span> the next day dawned, a soft
warm day, holding in it all the promise
of the Northland spring, Dick Bracknell
was in no condition to travel. He was clearly
much weaker, and at times he lapsed into delirium
during which the hearts of two of those with him
were wrung. The feverish babble was of nothing
relating to his life in the North, but about his boyhood
at Harrow Fell, and of his first meeting with
Joy. More than once Joy was unable to restrain
her tears, and as the day wore on, it was evident
that the strain was telling upon her.</p>

<p>Several times Roger Bracknell begged her to
leave the sick man and rest, but she shook her head.</p>

<p>“No,” she whispered on the last occasion.
“No! Look at him. It will not be very long. I
think I should like to be with him, when&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash; It
will help him, you know,” she concluded hastily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted, “you are quite right. He
told me in that lucid interval that these moments
with you by his side were among the happiest in his
life.”</p>

<p>She looked down at the drawn face, her eyes
flooding with sudden tears. She did not love him,
but there was a great pity in her heart for the wayward
man whose life had taken the wrong turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and whose nature as she now knew was as full of
generous good as of desperate evil. She prayed
for him silently, and leaving her with bowed head,
Roger Bracknell walked slowly away.</p>

<p>At the outer edge of the camp he met Sibou.
The latter waved a hand towards the river, on the
frozen surface of which tiny streams of water were
beginning to run.</p>

<p>“It is the spring,” he said. “If we do not leave
today the ice may not hold.”</p>

<p>“We cannot leave today, Sibou.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the Indian. “We wait for death.
Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“It is so!” agreed the corporal.</p>

<p>“And tomorrow comes the spring and new life,”
said the Indian thoughtfully. “That is the way,
always death on the heels of life, and life on the
heels of death.” He jerked his head towards the
camp. “The woman nurses the man who dies,
what is she to him?”</p>

<p>“She is his wife.”</p>

<p>“But she loves him not. I have watched her, I
have seen the light in her eyes.” He broke off
abruptly, and again waved his hand towards the
river. “But the spring comes, and with the spring
comes life and the kindling of the heart.”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell looked towards the river. He
knew that the Indian’s words were true, but he
offered no comment on them. Instead he watched
the water running on the ice, and after a minute he
asked abruptly, “How long will the ice hold,
Sibou?”</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is not to be told.” He pointed across the
river to where a tributary stream flowed into the
main river. “The water comes down there and
adds to the strength of this. It may break the ice
here, and spread over the surface. Listen.”</p>

<p>The corporal listened. The air was full of an
indescribable sound, a moaning and growling,
quite different to the sound of the soft wind in the
trees.</p>

<p>“Already the water fights for the mastery,” said
Sibou, “and tomorrow it may have won.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;today!” cried the corporal quickly, as
there came a sudden crash far out in front, and the
next moment a gaping fissure showed in the ice.</p>

<p>“Yes, today!” assented the Indian as he
watched. “That is the first, and there will be
others. The break up has come. The spring has
arrived.”</p>

<p>A cry from the camp startled them, and divining
what had happened, the white man began to
run. When he reached the fire he found Joy
standing by his cousin. Her eyes were burning with
tears. He looked at her, and as their eyes met,
she answered the question in his.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “a moment ago. He knew me
again at the last.”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell took a step forward, and
looked into the still face of his cousin. To him it
seemed extraordinarily peaceful, and the half-smile
on the lips caught and held by death told its
own story.</p>

<p>“He was happy in his death,” he said, “happier
than in life. Poor old Dick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned away, leaving Joy alone with the
dead for a little while. He knew that his cousin’s
death meant release for her, and for himself also,
since it would remove the bands of silence from
him. But in that moment he refused to think of
that aspect of the matter, and as with the help of
Sibou he bent a couple of young spruces, that his
cousin’s body might have the aerial sepulchre
practised by the Northern tribes, he reflected how
much of good there was in Dick, and how many
such there are who having taken the wrong turn
miss the full purpose of life.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the dead man was lashed to
the young trees which were released, carrying the
body high in the air. Such portions of the burial
service as Roger could remember were recited,
and then with Joy, he turned towards the camp.</p>

<p>“We will start in an hour, if you like,” he said.
“The ice is not very good, but it will be worse
tomorrow, and we can get some way towards
Chief Louis’ camp. Once there, ice or no ice will
not matter. We shall be able to get canoes.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “Yes, in an hour. There is no
reason why we should linger here now.”</p>

<p>They started before the hour was out; and
travelled hard until the edge of dark, avoiding
fissures which were ever increasing, and pitched
camp several miles away from their last resting-place.
In the night the corporal was awakened
by a crash somewhere on the river in front, and
in the morning he knew that sled-travelling was
over till the Northland winter should once more
bind the rivers. A stream of water was flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
on the surface of the ice. There were fissures
everywhere, and a distant rumble told him that
somewhere the ice was breaking up, Sibou came
and joined him, and together they looked across
the river. Something caught the Indian’s keener
eyes, something moving. He pointed it out to
Bracknell.</p>

<p>“There is a man there. He is coming this
way!” The corporal looked intently for a moment,
then he agreed. “Yes, it is a man. He is
alone. He has no dogs.”’</p>

<p>“Maybe they are lost,” said the Indian.</p>

<p>“He will never get across,” commented Bracknell,
“and we cannot warn him. He will have to
return.”</p>

<p>The Indian shaded his eyes against the rising
sun and watched, then he said, “He walks
strangely.”</p>

<p>Bracknell himself thought so. The man, whoever
he was, seemed to be making an erratic course,
and more than once just skirted a fissure. Twenty
minutes passed and then the two were joined by
Joy and her foster-sister. “What are you watching?”
asked Joy.</p>

<p>The corporal pointed to the man, now little
more than a hundred yards away. Joy looked and
cried out, and just at that moment Sibou started.</p>

<p>“The man is blind,” he said. “See how he
walks, hands in front groping for the way.
Behold! He did not see the ice.”</p>

<p>The stranger, whoever he was, had stumbled
over a cake of ice thrown out on the surface, and
as he picked himself up, he took his next step into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
a stream running fast over the yielding surface.
He withdrew the foot instantly and half turned
to try another course.</p>

<p>“It is the snow-blindness,” said Sibou. “He
cannot see. He only feels, and there is danger
everywhere for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Joy, “can nothing be done?”</p>

<p>“Something can be tried,” answered the corporal,
beginning to get down the bank.</p>

<p>Sibou followed him, and they moved towards the
blinded man in imminent risk of their lives. The
ice seemed to be in movement everywhere, and the
noise out on the river was increasing. Even as
they stepped on the ice, it broke loose from the
bank, and the rescuers felt it shake beneath their
feet. Cracks appeared through which the water
spurted, but they moved forward, for both were
aware that the ice beneath them might be thrown
into the air as by some living monster and themselves
thrown into the swirling water.</p>

<p>A providence seemed to watch over the blind
man. He had turned again and now was running
towards them. With a luck that was almost uncanny
he passed a couple of yawning cavities from
which the water welled, and once, he put his foot on
emptiness, he leaped from the other foot, and
crossed the danger before him at a bound. They
were but fifteen yards apart, when suddenly Sibou
stood still and gripped his companion’s arm.</p>

<p>“Behold!” he said quickly. “The man who
was with me when the trail was blown up before
Mr. Gargrave.”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell also stood still, and looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the figure shambling towards them. There was
a distraught look on the man’s face, a madness of
fear that convulsed it, but in spite of that Roger
Bracknell recognized it. It was the face of Adrian
Rayner.</p>

<p>Whilst he stood there, stunned, and held inactive
by the recognition, there was a sound of splintering
at the corporal’s feet, and instinctively both he
and Sibou leaped backward. The ice parted, and
a little lane of turgid water appeared between them
and the snow-blind man. The latter still came on.
Roger Bracknell watched him like a man hypnotized;
but when Rayner had almost reached the
place where the fracture had occurred, he cried
out suddenly, in agonized warning&mdash;</p>

<p>“Look out, Rayner! For God’s sake, look out!”</p>

<p>His cry must have been heard by Rayner, for the
latter halted suddenly, and threw up his arm as if
to ward off a blow. Then he gave a great cry of
fear, and turning suddenly began to run away from
the bank. He ran fast, helped by some great impulse
of fear, but he ran only a little way. A
stretch of open water appeared in the line he followed,
and unconscious of its existence, he ran
straight into it. They saw the plunge, and
watched painfully. A moment later his head appeared
above the water, and disappeared again,
as the rush of water hurled him forward. There
was no further sign of him, and as delay was
dangerous both of them turned and raced for the
bank.</p>

<p>As they gained it, the corporal saw a look of
horror on Joy Gargrave’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who was the man?” she asked. “I seemed to
recognize something about him.”</p>

<p>“It was Adrian Rayner.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I guessed it! I knew it! You recognized
him when you stopped?”</p>

<p>“Sibou recognized him first,” replied the corporal
meaningly.</p>

<p>“Sibou! I did not know that he&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I
remember. He was with the man who was responsible
for my father’s death.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Adrian Rayner was the man.”</p>

<p>Joy was silent for a moment, her eyes fixed on
the place where her cousin had met his death.
There was an enigmatic look in them which made
Roger Bracknell wonder. Then she spoke again.</p>

<p>“You halted when you recognized him? You
would not help him?”</p>

<p>“It was not that,” he answered quickly. “It
was just amazement that held me for a minute,
amazement and a feeling of horror that my suspicions
were proved right, though for weeks I have
been sure that Adrian Rayner was the guilty man.
He would have stepped into open water if I had not
suddenly cried out. I think he heard me, I think
he may have recognized my voice. He may have
been startled, though I think he was afraid at hearing
his name called out when he was without knowledge
that any one was near. As you saw he turned
and ran, but I saw his face as he stopped at my
hail, and it was stark with fear.”</p>

<p>After a few seconds the girl spoke again, her
eyes still on the tumult of the river.</p>

<p>“He was alone,” she said, “Snow-blind! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
wonder how that came about. He had two
Indians with him when he started.”</p>

<p>“He may have lost them, have wandered from
the camp or something of that sort. Or they may
have deserted him, carrying away the outfit. In
any case what has happened, terrible as it is, is
probably for the best. Rayner’s death saves him
a trial for murder, and the past need not be raked
up.”</p>

<p>Joy nodded, and looked once more to where the
broken floes were grinding each other in the waters
which had engulfed the guilty man.</p>

<p>“It is the judgment of God.”</p>

<p class="pc ls4">*****</p>

<p>It was five and a half months later when Roger
Bracknell, fresh from England, walked up the
road from the river leading to North Star Lodge.
There was a touch of frost in the air, and already
the wild geese were moving southward, and he
heard their honk! honk! as they flew over his head
for the warmer lands of the South, but he never so
much as lifted his eyes to look at them. His gaze
was fixed on the place where the road turned,
eagerly expectant, and from behind came the voyageurs’
song as his men unpacked the boat.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“What is there like to the laughing star,<br />
Far up from the lilac tree?<br />
A face that’s brighter and finer far,<br />
It laughs and it shines, ci, ci!&mdash;”</p>

<p class="pn1">The honk of the geese overhead for a moment
drowned the words, but they reached him again a
moment later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“&mdash;Till I go forth and bring it home,<br />
And house if within my door&mdash;<br />
Row along, row along home, ci, ci!”</p>

<p class="pn1">Then he turned the corner of the road. A girl
was hurrying between the long lines of trees. It
was Joy Gargrave. There was no laughter on
her face, but the blood was warm in it, and her eyes
were shining.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” she said, half sobbing with
gladness as he took her in his arms.</p>

<p>“At last,” he whispered, then together they
turned and walked towards the lodge.</p>

<p>“Babette?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“She is well!” Then Joy laughed gaily. “She
had the good sense to remain indoors. You know
she is going to be married.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“It has been arranged a long time, before ever
you came to North Star, but the little minx only
told me the other day, when she knew that you
were really coming back.”</p>

<p>“Who is the man?”</p>

<p>“An American engineer, James Sherlock. He
came here once or twice in the old days when my
father was alive. He is a very fine man.”</p>

<p>“I hope she will be happy.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of that,” answered Joy, “but
she will not be as happy as we shall. But what
news is there from England? My uncle?”</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell’s face grew a little graver as he
looked at her, then he said quietly, “I think I had
better tell you at once, and dismiss the unpleasantness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
once and for all.... I told him of his son’s
death, without telling him all that lay behind it.
It was a great shock to him&mdash;and for a little time
he broke down completely. He seemed to regard
it as in some way a judgment on himself, and he
made a confession to me.”</p>

<p>“A confession!” Joy stopped and looked at him
with eyes that were wide with fear. “You do not
mean that he knew that Adrian intended&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He knew nothing, not even of your marriage
with Dick, and even now he does not know that
your father’s death was anything but accidental.
He was, I could tell, in complete ignorance of the
real object of his son’s journey here, and thought
it had to do with his confessed infatuation for you.
The confession he made had to do with his financial
affairs. It appears that he has speculated rashly,
that his affairs have become very much involved,
and that absolute control of your money was
needed to save him.”</p>

<p>“I gave it,” cried Joy.</p>

<p>“Yes! and it did save him. Some of his ventures
turned out very well after all, but that matters
nothing now. Adrian was the apple of his
eye, and his loss, as I said, he regarded as a personal
judgment on himself as he had first sent
Adrian to North Star in the hope that the match
he desired would come to pass.”</p>

<p>“But he did not know of Dick. He was not
party to my cousin’s schemes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am sure he was in absolute ignorance.”</p>

<p>“Thank God! He was always kind to me, and
I could not bear to think that he was in my cousin’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
confidence. He wanted me to marry Adrian, but
he thought that I was free.”</p>

<p>“He is going out of business, and I have arranged
with him to transfer your affairs to a firm
that manages the Harrow Fell estates. When we
go to England&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When will that be?” asked Joy quickly.</p>

<p>Roger Bracknell smiled. “There is no hurry.
I thought I might winter up here&mdash;that is if you are
agreeable.”</p>

<p>She looked at him reproachfully. “You know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait! You have not heard everything, Joy!
Down the river I passed the missionary priest,
Father Doherty. He is going North&mdash;racing the
winter. He knows he has already lost the race,
and that he will have to finish his journey on the
ice. I ventured to persuade him to break the
journey at the Lodge, and he agreed to do so. It
was very audacious of me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why should it be audacious? Travellers are
always welcome at North Star.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he answered smilingly, “he is a priest
you know.”</p>

<p>For a couple of seconds she looked at him
wonderingly, then comprehension came to her, and
a blush mantled her face.</p>

<p>“It <i>was</i> very audacious of you,” she said.
“Very! But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But what?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am glad that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“That Father Doherty is a priest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed with gladness as he stooped to kiss
her; and when they resumed their way, she asked,
“When will he arrive?”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow, I think.”</p>

<p>“So soon?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;so long!” he corrected smilingly.</p>

<p>“And we shall have a winter honeymoon at
North Star?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“That,” she said, “will be delightful!”</p>

<p>And as she spoke, through the trees the Lodge
appeared in sight, and to them drifted a fragment
of the boatman’s song&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“&mdash;Till I go forth and bring it home,<br />
And enter and close my door&mdash;<br />
Row along, row along home, ci, ci!”</p>
